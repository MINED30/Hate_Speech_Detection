The different races in Tolkien's world barely tolerate each other, only cooperating when their literal existence is at stake.  Elves live in their forests and shun travelers, and eventually altogether leave the world en masse because they find Middle Earth unbearable.  Dwarves hole up in their mountains and lock the doors, eventually dying when something more powerful than them shows up to take their stuff.  Men are either self-assured that they have no need of the other races, or are too busy trying to make a living to worry about other races.  Orcs, trolls, goblins, and the like exist to fulfill their own primal needs of hunger, conquest, and bloodshed; for them, the good races exist only to be slaughtered, enslaved, and eaten.  And the Hobbits want nothing to do with any of them.  Most D&D settings are going to naturally be more homogenous than Tolkien's Middle Earth.

Calling it a 'scam' seems pretty unsubstantiated, since the dev team is constantly expanding and improving the product.  Clearly money isn't being socked away in someone's offshore bank account.  Saying it has taken too long has more merit.  But after the unexpectedly wildly successful kickstarter, the project manager asked the backers if they should similarly wildly expand the scope of the project... and most were in favor of it.  So all that money went into a much bigger game than was originally pitched.  Finally, their methods of raising funds have also been criticized.  And for me, this is the seediest part of the game.  Offering a land claim token which will eventually allow them to choose land in the universe to gain legal (though imperfect) NPC protection for is silly.  On the other hand, the process has been very open and clear to all from the start, so anyone who does contribute funds should know what they are (and aren't) getting.

            "No, sorry.  &#x200B;  It's actually an objectively piss-poor, utterly retarded take made by people trying to cast star wars as extremist religious idiots.  &#x200B;  There's so much...wrong with almost all of their assertions and none of it makes any god-damn sense. For one, the whole \"You didn't like Jarjar, but you got over it.\" is actually and factually just total and utter bullshit. Episode one is so reviled that it even popped up in tons of pop culture.  &#x200B;  Here's what happened to the fandom: shitting on things via youtube became extremely popular post Redlettermedia. RLM basically took what was a poorly formed, not very good consensus of \"I don't like Jarjar.\" and replaced it with a litany of very good criticisms that slammed Lucas for every single writing decision he's ever made in all of his movies. He carefully and expertly filleted everything about that movie, and he pointed out things that were shit that nobody(literally) had ever pointed out before in nerd circles. He managed to do this in a way that didn't really feel like some fat comic book guy screaming at the screen, mostly because he did it in a funny voice, had a character that was an easy-to-laugh-at caricature(an obese, old as fuck serial killer) and most of his shit was new content. It wasn't 70 minutes of screaming about Jarjar. A good example would be him pointing out having different stories going on muddles the emotional impact of the entire finale...which is true. Nobody had ever pointed that out(despite the fact that it's basically stated in the behind the scenes footage by the film's editor). George Lucas was *so mad* about the Mr. Plinkett reviews that he quit film-making all together. Literally. He didn't name names, but he did say \"people on the internet\" and it's a *very* fair assumption that the TPM review was a huge part of that. He can't take being told certain things and bailed the fuck out.  &#x200B;  Anyway, after Plinkett comes out and transforms the general understanding of criticizing something, instead of bitching about endings, instead of bitching about a specific  character, people now wish to ape and take off from RLM's success and start doing it as much as they possibly can. Since SW was sold, there was a big explosion of reviewer channels and there's a lot of people who go out of their way to 'clone' the Plinkett style. Sometimes they just try to be smart and come up with original reasons for Why Something Is Shit, and sometimes they literally use the name music and sound stings.   &#x200B;  Point is, Plinkett opened the doors for being pissed about something on the internet to be more viable than it has ever been. You can make some serious cash doing it and get a ton of followers.   Another issue was timing - and another issue is that when you're loudly and openly political, you can't be taken with a benefit of the doubt. Sure maybe Mace Windu existed because they wanted to have a black dude in the movie, but like, nobody every stated \"That's right, black people can use the force, too!\" Wearing \"The Force Is Female\" shirts makes a dude side-eye everything you're doing, because now it's not \"oh, neat, a girl.\" It's, \"Oh, I see, This is the Agenda at work.\" When you openly state you have an agenda, only the dumbest of fuckers will assume you're not aggressively pushing it with every statement.\n",

            "The well deserved hate for this sort of Tumblr style reporting on the BBC aside for a moment...  &nbsp;  You're playing a game... on the internet... something MP or MMO which requires interacting with other people.  For somebody to even figure out what gender you are let alone your race, you at least need to use some sort of voice communication.  So, voice communication might out you as a woman, depending on your accent/origin it's not inconceivable somebody might figure out you're black as well.  Those are a whole lot of different things that need to fall into place though for that to be possible.  Avoid voice coms and nobody knows whether you're a green trans midget or a strong black womyn... and nobody gives a shit either.   &nbsp;  That's kinda one of the three salient points I want to make here...  - Nobody gives a shit who/what you are.  The second point is that in most competitive MP games people give each other shit.  For the most part that means getting in the easy hits.  You're a guy: that makes you a fag, gay, dick, asshole, etc... (A cunt in AUS)  You're a woman: that makes you a bitch, a cunt, etc...  You're black: Makes you a nigger, a coon, etc...  &nbsp;  I.e. my second point is that:  - people generally hit the low hanging fruit regarding insults and depending on the game you play - everybody gets insulted at some point.  &nbsp;  Beyond all that, even with voice coms, nobody knows whether you are straight, bi, gay, lesbian, trans, moonkin or whatever else...  So even with voice coms, gender identity doesn't even enter into the picture unless you yourself make an issue of it.  Which brings me to my third point:  - Gamers will treat you as one of their own until you go out of your way to distinguish yourself from them and try to be anything other than part of the game.  \"I'm a girl\", \"I'm gay\", \"I'm trans\", \"I'm black\", \"I'm Asian\", \"I'm a Martian\" etc...  Who cares? Gamers don't tend to care until you start rubbing it into their faces.  &nbsp;  Long story short, as long as you put being a gamer first while you're playing games with other people, nobody gives a fuck what you do with the rest of your life.   &nbsp;  [edit] This became much more of a rant than I originally intended it to be and I'm not even sure I managed to get the point across that I wanted to get across...\n",

She got to stay at home while he worked hard to support the both the woman, and the child for the betterment of their financial future. She somehow finds a way to complain and concludes her situation was \"like being a single mom\" which is absolutely delusional. Most single moms either have to raise their child while working full time or rely heavily on social services.  TWO. The husband was never abusive nor did he cheat on her at any time. Rather than find ways to improve herself and improve the marriage, she goes to a few counselling sessions and then retains a lawyer to end the marriage.  This is consistent with the finding that women initiate 2/3 of all divorce:  > A recent study by the American Sociological Association found that **women initiate two thirds of all divorces, a staggering 69% to be exact. An even higher rate of 90% of all divorces are initiated by college-educated women.**  THREE. Women are the ones that overwhelming pressure men into marrying them, thus fuelling a huge wedding industry in which women jockey for status in their social circles to see who can have the most extravagant wedding and biggest ring. As soon the marriage hits a rough patch and stops being fun and games, women are again fuelling a huge divorce industry by being the ones most likely to initiate divorce; which is helped along by books and movies such as \"Eat, Pray, Love\" which glamourizes divorce. It's essentially porn for divorced women.\n",

Secondly, as an example, if Kevin Federline initiated a divorce with Britney Spears because he felt like a \"single dad\" and he became a fat slob who couldn't attract anyone, and she found happiness with a new partner who was more ambitious and appreciative than he was, would it be man-hating to make a post about that in a corresponding sub?   She wanted the marriage. She got it. She was unhappy.  She wanted the divorce. She got it. She's still unhappy.  He's found someone new and moved on without her, and she's even more unhappy.

Personally, I don't think we should make a huge deal about under-21's drinking, but the law's the law, and here's why she's wrong:  She told the cops that she was 20.  Being underage and in possession of alcohol is a crime (MIC).  When a police officer has reasonable suspicion or probable cause of a person committing a crime, that suspect MUST identify themselves to the police.  They gave her the chance to show that an overage person was the one with the alcohol, which not only did she not take, but she was really rude to them when they were very patient with her trashy, belligerent, entitled behavior.     If you refuse to identify yourself at this point, you can be arrested - period.  By trying to walk away, she's evading/resisting, and when she pushes the officer, now it's resisting arrest AND felony assaulting a police officer in addition to the MIC.  Then when she kicks the other cop (another count of assaulting a police officer), they treated her like they would any man, and rightly so.  Lastly,  when she tried (and failed) to spit on the officer, that's yet ANOTHER count of attempted assault of a police officer, as bodily fluids count in that category.  On top of that, the whole time she is screaming about how her child is there, using that child as a shield, etc., but the worst part is that's the example she's setting for her kid.\n",

I have no issue with her being fined or arrested for her actions but the response of the officer is disproprionate and here would be seen as an extreme reaction to someone smaller and weaker than the officer.   Additionally, I find it disturbing how much joy some here take in seeing someone being punched.

But violence, especially something like what was described, usually has an escalation and there are usually repeated crimes or attempts at crimes.   Again, it's entirely possible he and a friend decided to randomly attempt to sexually assault a classmate and for either to ever attempt any form of such violence again, but it doesn't fit the pattern for the average sexual predator.  >but it was severely hamstrung.

            "I wish I didn't, but I actually do understand how that event could have been an isolated incident, especially given that Kavanaugh and Judge were likely blacked out. One sexual assault is enough for me to say that someone should not sit on the SCOTUS. Beyond that, these kinds of allegations are extremely hard to prove and often don't come to light for many years, because the only evidence that could come up is testimony, so I see why incidents like these, if there were more, would easily slip through an investigation. At least one of Kavanaugh's former Yale friends has contradicted Kavanaugh's reports of how much he drank.   I also understand why Ford would not have pressed charges when she was 16 (or at any time within the statute of limitations). If you understand why any of the women in Hollywood who've come forwards with allegations against Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein did not do so earlier, for example, then I think you also understand. These things are difficult to prove (it's a he-said-she-said situation and the courts necessarily and I believe rightfully *must* have a high bar for proof; that's kind of just the nature of the crime and of our justice system), a criminal prosecution is humiliating and lengthy, and punishments even in the \"perfect\" rape case (like that Stanford swimmer) are too often pretty minimal. Imagine being 16 and trying to tell your parents about this and everything that will be said about you in court and behind your back. Imagine all the intimate details of your life that might become public at your school and what your friends/classmates/neighbors might think or say and believe or condemn. Ford, in her, testimony, said that was terrified to come forward but believed that she had a civic duty to do so. She only tried to come forwards after it became apparent that Kavanaugh was one of the final picks for the SCOTUS. I also understand that reasoning and how this civic duty changed the balance of her decision to speak up.  I get most of my news from NPR and the Journal and I linked some relevant articles/pieces that answer most of your questions, but I'll answer them anyway. Hamstrung compared to [the investigation that never was](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/01/653430574/former-fbi-agent-discusses-practices-for-background-probes-into-federal-judges). A supplemental investigation is already a deviation. The transcripts of the six interviews would have been passed off exclusively to the Senate in their report, which was not released to the public. Yes, of course that is within their power. The third accuser (and her attorney, Avenati, who is kinda trashy imo, tbh) was omitted, because the WH directed the FBI to only look into the first two allegations. We don't exactly know the WH's instructions to the FBI, but we do know that the WH gave limiting instructions or permitted Senate Republicans to do so and that the resulting investigation only included six interviews.   I did listen to the entire testimony, which is far from exceptional. Nearly 20% of American households were tuned in, not including those of us who were streaming it.

            ">Kavanaugh and Judge were likely blacked   Proof of their over drinking? Also, drinking heavily doesn't just turn you into a sexual predator, and by the Judge's own admission, he drank significantly at this time,  so it is entirely possible that he and the other accused would again offer repeated behavior.  >I wish I didn't, but I actually do understand how that event could have been an isolated incident,  Ok, share.   > extremely hard to prove  Correct, which is why they shouldn't be used to judge a person.  >incidents like these, if there were more, would easily slip through an investigation.   The key word is \"incidents.\" That's how predators usually get caught, they leave body trail. This has not be proven for the Judge.  > At least one of Kavanaugh's former Yale friends has contradicted Kavanaugh's reports of how much he drank.  Was the friend black out drunk?

            "It's hard to reply to you when you're just counter-pointing (and counter-pointing is so easy, dude, come on), not offering any real substance, and definitely haven't read any of the sources I've cited to you. Most of your questions are answered in there and there's not much point to me re-hashing it to you. You're mostly asking me about facts that could easily be found in a newspaper. The former Yale classmate was in [this WSJ article that I also linked above](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kavanaugh-fight-in-state-of-uncertainty-1538401675?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1) but here's [the full text of his statement](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/us/politics/chad-ludington-statement-brett-kavanaugh.html). Four years ago, Kavanaugh himself [reminisced about binge drinking in college](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-kavanaugh-drinking-20180925-story.html) and his [high school yearbook was full of references to alcohol](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/business/brett-kavanaugh-yearbook-renate.html) and the attitude and decision-making behind the \"Renate Alumni\" thing is horrific. And let's get real, [Brett Kavanaugh was definitely the inspiration for \"Bart O’Kavanaugh\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/27/mark-judges-book-validates-christine-fords-timeline-alleged-kavanaugh-assault/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2affad39e45e) in Mark Judge's book.  >Ok, share.  I'm not sure what you're asking me.  >I don't have to.  I don't understand what you're trying to say here. Again, it's hard to get a bearing on what you're saying because you're really not making any points. What makes you believe that Ford would have stepped forwards when she was 16 if the story is true? You seem to agree that we know not all women do who later seem to have valid claims, so not having stepped forward does not necessarily mean the story is made up.  It's within the scope of the FBI's powers to give a report to the Senate, because that was the background check. You are telling me to cite (not \"site\" btw) a source that the FBI has the authority to produce a background check that was requested of it for the Senate.  >She was fine for his entire career before he was nominated.  Yes, dude. Do you not know what a civic duty is? It's an obligation not to yourself, but to your country, a burden of good citizenship like voting or serving on a jury. The transcripts are online, but the relevant sentence of Ford's testimony is, \"I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh’s conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault.\" You could have consulted a dictionary or listened to Ford's testimony.  >This happened to both of them.  Again, the civic duty thing changed the balance. I think (hope) that we agree that these kinds of allegations should not be made lightly and should not be taken lightly. The consequences of both airing out a false allegation and of suppressing a real one are severe. It's inherently a balancing act, so, yes, both of their lives are now set before the court of public opinion. Kavanaugh, however, is a public figure, so he put himself out there by nature of his occupation choices, but that's a minor point. I think the bigger point is just that *this is the nature of our adversarial system of law.* The point I was trying to make about the embarrassment and publicness of these allegations, investigations, and prosecutions is not that they shouldn't happen (although we should be cautious, and they've kind of gotten out of hand recently), but that they are an understandable deterrent. I'm not making an argument for whether or not it should change. That's a whole other conversation. I'm making the argument that in light of this, it is understandable why a real victim might not step forwards *until the added conviction that it is her civic duty* tipped the balance in favor of stepping forwards even so many years afterwards.  You're missing the point about the supplemental FBI investigation. It was excessively limited in scope and a weak defense for the argument that Kavanaugh never did any of the things alleged. Avenati's trashy (he was Stormy Daniels' attorney, for reference), but that was a side-comment/personal opinion and no excuse for the FBI not even interviewing him or his client. Do you really believe that the supplemental investigation was sufficient? What makes you believe that?  I don't think you follow the news, dude. I heard the 20% thing on NPR, but you can Google it, or just do the math on the source I did cite you to immediately afterwards yourself. I'm in law school, so I'm also busy. I didn't listen to all of the testimonies live, but I did stream it afterwards. You're getting defensive because you haven't kept up with this issue as well as you could have. No, I don't know if they listened to the whole thing, but it gives you a ball park of how much of the country was tuned in *when you weren't*.\n",
            ">counter-pointing  You made a specific accusation and I asked for proof. If you don't have proof for it, don't make it, dude.   >definitely haven't read any of the sources I've cited to you  I don't respect half your sources, and they weren't directly related to what I asked. If you can prove otherwise, quote it directly.   >Kavanaugh himself reminisced about binge drinking in college   Yes, that doesn't make you commit sexual assault, it doesn't make you always black out drunk everytime you drink, especially since college was years later, and it also doesn't make the other individual also black out drunk everytime he drinks or commit sexual assault.   > the attitude and decision-making behind the \"Renate Alumni\" thing is horrific.   Thsn't ea ivence for the crime he is accused of. Being in a crime ridden neighborhood doesn't make you a criminal.    >You are telling me to cite (not \"site\" btw) a source that the FBI has the authority to produce a background check that was requested of it for the Senate.    >I'm not sure what you're asking me.  >I wish I didn't, but I actually do understand how that event could have been an isolated incident, especially given that Kavanaugh and Judge were likely blacked out.   You said you knew how you can sexually assault some one while blacked out.     >es, dude. Do you not know what a civic duty is? I  He was a powerful judge before he was nominated. They don't nominate some nobody ruling on traffic tickets to the supreme court. Her sense of civic duty sure takes its time.   >You could have consulted a dictionary or listened to Ford's testimony.  Thanks for insulting my intelligence.  >It was excessively limited in scope and a weak defense for the argument that Kavanaugh never did any of the things alleged.  A weak defense that defended against weaker allegations.   > I heard the 20% thing on NPR,  I heard it so it's proof.   Really?   I don't know you. I have no reason to believe you. That's why I asked for a source.  > I'm in law school  That's terrifying.   >No, I don't know if they listened to the whole thing, but it gives you a ball park of how much of the country was tuned in when you weren't.  I read about it. But I guess listening on the radio is while picking up the kids and thinking about what to cook for dinner is a better and more thorough choice than studying a document.  You're really in law school? Really?  >You're missing the point about the supplemental FBI investigation.  I'm not missing the point. The point I was making, that you have failed to address, is that there are no hard dates given by the main witness, the a lternative witness was discredited and has a sleaze ball lawyer (I'm thoroughly aware of the actual case he lost so badly that his client had to pay the fees of the defense) and that 6 separate previous investigations failed to discredit him previously and the supplemental FBI investigation failed to do so either.   I like evidence before I ruin a person's life, even if I disagree with him.   Edit: phone being difficult with errors, also added context.\n",

Just because a person doesn't see confidence as humanity's final form doesn't mean that person is some sort of sleazy guy trying to play on girls' insecurities.

If she doesn't know, why is she there?  And if she does know, why do we have to treat her like an autistic case, a retarded person, or a person suffering from dementia by assuming she doesn't understand *basic things* adults ought to know?

Are women really *that stupid* that they can't even understand this?

All those issues he brings up, could have been given to any other of the cardboard cut-out vampire generals to bring up, actually flesh them out a bit instead of just being stand-ins, and leave Godbrand to be the brash douchebag that still accidentally ruins part of Carmilla's plans.  Let's go even a step further: why the fuck was Dracula so adamant in genocide, yet did nothing but mope around like fucking Gabriel in LoS? Yes, the character does not REALLY want to sully his hands due to the conflicting feelings he has, but he didn't really have to do the work himself, and the show goes out of its way to demonstrate that he WOULDN'T do it himself. So why is the almighty lord of darkness, the king of fucking vampires, not cracking the whip on the Vamp Spice Girls and telling them \"Do this, do that, no questions\"?

Also, don't buy into the narrative that \"the previous waves are ok\" - they were all an example of movements with good intentions that had bad results and extremely bad actions.  They got some of what they wanted but a lot of shitty things happened to society to get to where they wanted.  For example, you can thank the suffragettes for winning the women's vote, but also forgetting to require women to enroll in the selected service *to* vote and get student aid, meanwhile ALL MALES are required to do so.  Oh by the way, all rich property owners before the suffragette movement started were allowed to vote, INCLUDING WOMEN.  The suffragette movement didn't fight for the rights of lower class or black women to vote either, just those of the bourgeois and upper class - does that fucking sound familiar to you?  Also the suffragettes were *very* violent back then.  Some of them behaved like the anti-fa of today.

Even then what lots of people don't seem to understand is that if a government doesn't allow you to defend yourself(sometimes even legally at all with improved on the stop weapons) with weapons then they don't give a shit whether you live or die- which makes them a shit abusive government.  I can get wanting to have a sweet spot for that, but it's pretty clear most governments just think they are a better breed of human than those they rule over. That is why I think it's so fucking retarded when the dipshits say \"Common sense gun control\". For one the \"control\" is a giant rippling red flag, for two in the us you already fucking have things that are frankly according to the Constitution \"infringements\", that lots of people find fairly tolerable even those who own and use lots of weapons. It's funny how they seem to think their aren't background checks when the only way you can not have them is limited as fuck sales between people- which you can't really control anyway as it's nigh impossible to track.  If you do any half decent amount of business with guns you *have* to get a FFL. Even a pawn shop that may have like 10 guns top at any given time would have to have a fucking FFL.  I'm sick of either complete ignorant dumbasses that don't even try to do any real search- even the basis trying to act like they know what is good for everyone else, or worse yet deliberate fucking liars- that still probably don't know shit but they know just enough to know they are wrong and crooked.

They don't want us filthy plebs breeding too much, unless we are their slaves. I mean that was the point of abortion with cunts like Sanger. Kill all the darkies so they can't rise up against the whites- or as of now, and maybe as of always the *right kind of whites*- not saying jews I'm just saying the \"elite class\"  Everything about marxism is about class warfare. How to get all the plebs fighting against each other so the elites are safe. Just when the soviet's started it the crooked power hungry ones weren't the elites yet, so they had to fix that. After that they had to make it so only *they* could say who gets to be in the elite class.  The more things change, the more only the names change and the elitist power hungry crooks are always the same kind of people- besides in random exceptions.

Are we really all that different now as the human speices save for techonolgy than when we had fredual lords, and only the right kind of people who served the guys at the tippy top got to be in the peerage? If someone basically was so awesome even though they weren't in the elite to begin with they had to be let in it pissed the elites off so much, because it shows that if anyone is good enough they need to be let in, or they can always just break down the door and take it for themselves, and that pisses them off.

Hij die opzettelijk iemands eer of goede naam aanrandt, door telastlegging van een bepaald feit, met het kennelijke doel om daaraan ruchtbaarheid te geven, wordt, als schuldig aan smaad, gestraft met gevangenisstraf van ten hoogste zes maanden of geldboete van de derde categorie.  2. Indien dit geschiedt door middel van geschriften of afbeeldingen, verspreid, openlijk tentoongesteld of aangeslagen, of door geschriften waarvan de inhoud openlijk ten gehore wordt gebracht, wordt de dader, als schuldig aan smaadschrift, gestraft met gevangenisstraf van ten hoogste een jaar of geldboete van de derde categorie.  3. Noch smaad, noch smaadschrift bestaat voor zover de dader heeft gehandeld tot noodzakelijke verdediging, of te goeder trouw heeft kunnen aannemen dat het te last gelegde waar was en dat het algemeen belang de telastlegging eiste.  Artikel 266 - eenvoudige belediging  1. Elke opzettelijke belediging die niet het karakter van smaad of smaadschrift draagt, hetzij in het openbaar mondeling of bij geschrift of afbeelding, hetzij iemand, in zijn tegenwoordigheid mondeling of door feitelijkheden, hetzij door een toegezonden of aangeboden geschrift of afbeelding, aangedaan, wordt, als eenvoudige belediging, gestraft met gevangenisstraf van ten hoogste drie maanden of geldboete van de tweede categorie. 2. Niet als eenvoudige belediging strafbaar zijn gedragingen die ertoe strekken een oordeel te geven over de behartiging van openbare belangen, en die er niet op zijn gericht ook in ander opzicht of zwaarder te grieven dan uit die strekking voortvloeit.  Artikel 267 - belediging ambtenaar, openbaar gezag, hoofd bevriende staat De in de voorgaande artikelen van deze titel bepaalde gevangenisstraffen kunnen met een derde worden verhoogd, indien de belediging wordt aangedaan aan: 1°. het openbaar gezag, een openbaar lichaam of een openbare instelling; 2°. een ambtenaar gedurende of ter zake van de rechtmatige uitoefening van zijn bediening; 3°. het hoofd of een lid van de regering van een bevriende staat.  Zoals u kunt lezen is de eenvoudige belediging als uitzondering geformuleerd op smaad geformuleerd. Wanneer er geen sprake is van smaad, terwijl toch de eer en goede naam van een ander wordt aangerand, is er sprake van eenvoudige belediging.   In de tenlastelegging zien we bij belediging van een ambtenaar in functie vaak de volgende omschrijving:  hij op of omstreeks [datum] te [plaats], althans in het arrondissement Utrecht, opzettelijk beledigend (een) ambtena(a)r(en), te weten [ambtenaar] en/of [ambtenaar 1] (respectievelijk brigadier en agent van politie Utrecht), gedurende en/of ter zake van de rechtmatige uitoefening van zijn/hun bediening, in diens/dier tegenwoordigheid mondeling heeft toegevoegd de woorden \"Flikkers\", althans woorden van gelijke beledigende aard en/of strekking.\n",
            ". \t\t\t\t**Verbal abuse**  Verbal abuse (verbal attack or verbal assault) is when a person forcefully criticizes, insults, or denounces someone else. Characterized by underlying anger and hostility, it is a destructive form of communication intended to harm the self-concept of the other person and produce negative emotions. Verbal abuse is a maladaptive mechanism that anyone can display occasionally, such as during times of high stress or physical discomfort. For some people, it is a pattern of behaviors used intentionally to control or manipulate others or to get revenge.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28\n",

The way people engage with this is by sobbing apparently, and that's absurd. That first idiot kept saying \"I've been raped and I know people here who've been raped, that's not 1 in 1000!\" That's not how statistics work! Honestly, I feel bad for these people. They seem to honestly think that our culture condones rape. I'd be pretty nettled too, if I believed that. I'd probably be rather stressed out all the time if I lived in the Middle East.   The argument that makes sense is that sometimes institutions protect rapists because of the status of the rapist. But the thing that people miss is that *everyone hates when institutions do this*. It's not like a college protects it's star running back and everyone's like \"welp, all's well that ends well.\" No, people lose their fucking minds! People still talk about *Brock Turner* because he got off too easy on a rape charge. People ought to start asking college kids what needs to be done to eliminate rape culture, so that we could get better insight into what they think it is. It's inevitably going to be something like \"we ask women what they were wearing\" or \"people who get accused still have running water\". It's completely disconnected from reality.\n",

            "I'm going to devils advocate against Crowder for a second:  I think that if you allowed for a rather generous definition of \"Rape Culture\", a rape culture _actually does exist_ on college campuses. Hear me out.   At least, up until the recent Title IX insanity, here's what's going to happen. Say you have been raped, assaulted, or otherwise have a credible accusation. You go to the school administration (your first mistake!) over this. What do they do?  Obviously, rape is really really bad and the school administration wants to prevent it, stop it, and bring consequences on the predator. But... there's other factors.  Maybe it turns out that the accused is from a very politically well-connected family, and if you pursue action against hi, his parents make trouble for you. Maybe his cousin is a major donor to the school, or he is a star student in sports or academics and has a really great reputation that the school gets to enjoy by proxy. Or maybe, maybe the school just wants to keep their risk of reputation damage to a minimum.  It doesn't really matter the specifics. The fact remains that _*the university's priority is to protect the university, not the students*_. The university is working with HR bureaucracy incentives: make the problem go away as cheaply and quickly as possible so we can get back to business as usual. Often times, and _especially_ in more ambiguous situations (everything from regret-sex to he-said-she-said situations), the easiest way to do that is to take the bare minimum token action so the victim feels like you did something, and then sweep it under the rug. No investigation that makes rumours spread, no spooky increase in rape stats for your campus, no potentially making powerful people mad. Just Make It Go Away.   If you're someone who is actually a victim, and you actually want justice, and you go to the administration, and this happens, you could be forgiven for believing that this is representative of a \"rape culture\". From your perspective it sure looks like _rape happened and they didn't care_. But in reality it's just a natural consequence of the fact that bureaucracies follow incentives and the university has some very strong incentives hanging over it, much stronger than one hysterical freshman.  But I would argue that it is absurd to call this a 'rape culture'. Even if the situation I've laid out means that it is literally true that there is a culture that covers up rape, it is still incorrect to call that a rape culture. Why? Because 'rape culture' has a connotation that this is about rape specifically, and that it's at least partially intentional. In fact, the situation is actually caused by a higher level, more general thing, for which the rape scenario is just one of many consequences. If anything, it's an \"incentive culture\" or a \"cover-your-ass culture\".  Of course, the fundamental cause of this whole scenario is a mistake on the part of the victim: Why the _*fuck*_ would you go to _university administration_ over a _crime_. The university administration is NOT fair and NOT neutral. They are in fact heavily biased in favour of \"whatever costs them less time, money, and effort\". They're NOT your friends. The university administration solves problems for _the university_ and sometimes the problem (to them) is the victim who won't drop the issue.   All of this, ALL OF IT, is trivially solved if people do what they're supposed to do and _*report crimes to the police*_.   For an analogy, imagine an HR department at work. Imagine you have a problem with someone at work. Doesn't matter what it is. Do you report them to HR?   What if the problem is that this other asshole is constantly muttering insults under his breath towards you. Oh, also, this asshole has been here for 15 years and singlehandedly saved the company from bankruptcy. And you started 3 weeks ago.   If you go to the HR department they're immediately going to think \"oh, seriously? The veteran employee _saved our company_ and this dipshit who hasn't even been here for three years can't take a joke about it? We have to get the newbie to shut up before the veteran gets pissed and quits to take that job at Google we know he's been eyeing\". They want _the situation_ to go away but that is not the same as solving your problem.  The absolute best case scenario for you going to HR is that HR brings in the senior guy and tells him to knock it off. And now he's mad. He knows that you narc'd him out to HR for the things he said and now he's pissed. Out of spite he'll give you terrible performance reviews and you'll never get promoted. He'll make even snarkier comments but always in a way that's plausibly deniable. By going to HR over this, the only thing you did was make your problem worse.  You could look at this situation and say \"SEE, THIS COMPANY HAS A HARASSMENT CULTURE\" but that's not true. Actually, this company has one guy who is kind of an asshole, that everybody kind of hates, but also the company realizes that there's some unpleasant realities about the world that can't be escaped.   If you're the victim in this situation, you could spent your whole life getting bitter over it and complain about how corporate america has a harassment culture. You could see your career stagnate as you spent too much time complaining and not enough time doing your job. You could turn into a pathetic shell of a human being. Or you could man up, take some simple and commonsense actions to stop the petty jokes (eg maybe avoid him in the hallway), and if the behaviour is sufficiently severe, go to the police over it.

            "I *mostly* agree with you, and I've been involved in a Title IX incident.  To make it short: I was actually the \"victim\" of harassment that was reported by someone (henceforth identified as the complainant). My \"harasser\" came to me to help me write a letter to the tribunal that identified why he was of good character.  My university never talked *to me* about *being the victim of harassment*. I was never summoned to the hearing. The entire tribunal was based off of *hearsay*.  As such, you are absolutely correct that *some* universities use it to just cover their ass. However, this is not what the college feminists are supposed to be doing. The job of the college feminists is to use this system to destroy and railroad defendants, then funnel the accusers into the feminist racket to pursue further criminal charges against the defendant, using the tribunal's decision as evidence against him, in addition to all of the free resources and legal assistance she will be getting, in addition to the institutional discrimination already within a lot of sex crime training.  A lot of universities responded aggressively to the dear colleague letter at the behest of feminists as well as a way to protect their funding. However, it's primary purpose is political. It's secondary purpose is to place feminist activists in key positions where they can also *threaten* the college's funding if they don't get their way by immediately complaining to the feds that the University wasn't abiding by Title IX. Simultaneously, the feminist activists became \"keystone\" employees that could have *incredible* power over the rest of the school by threatening funding, removing students who were accused, or ignoring students who's complaints they didn't find valid.  The system is built not at the interests of the school, but the interests of politics *in order to force the school to comply*. Make the school dependent on the political activists for covering their ass, and the ideologues become essential. It's actually a very old Bolshevik move.\n",

The sheer amount of arrogance and virtue signaling is strong enough to wake up the old ones from their endless sleep in the abyss.

I would agree on that one, but I'm sensing the inability of Mrs Greer to distinguish between the actions/thoughts of the characters in the novels and the actual thoughts of Lovecraft.  I've read a great (great) amount of HP.L works, and some of his stories could definitly be interpreted as racist. Some of them are better than others. Some of them are just bad. It *doesn't* mean we have to throw away his work like a piece of trash, while praising the god of virtue for this sacrifice.  > what Lovecraft gave to the genre of cosmic horror was his hate   Well, I guess I'll just admit that as well, afterall, it's written on the internet so it must be true.  &#x200B;  > Which is now video games' problem.   Oh ... I thought it was harassment and misoginy. Now it's a matter of tentacles and white male heroes.  >For decades video games have been regurgitating the themes, plots and aesthetics of his stories with not one ounce of scrutiny.   Indeed, we live under a Lovecraftian patriarchy that's ruling over the video games' kingdom ...   \\- *Silent hill maybe ?*    *- No! Examples and logic are the tools of the oppressors !*  >the troubled white male heroes that contain his arrogance and his gross simplification of mental illness are recreated in video games with no subversion, no critical thinking   Says the girl who's calling for a ban whithout having substantial knowledge of the subject.  But I guess next time I encounter a three headed shoggoth, I'll try not to run and overcome my will of simplification.  &#x200B;  > Here's the other thing. It's not just deeply problematic, it's boring.   This is *litterally* becoming a statement from the fun police.  *\"This is NOT fun, you hear ?!\"*  Thing is, I would agree that *seing* the same stuff over and over again could become quite boring in the end, but what's cool about the novels is that they are, you know ... novels. And immagination is a waaay more resourceful friend than any rendered monstrosity, when it comes to fear and despair.  &#x200B;  > It's time to let go of Lovecraft   Jawohl mein Kommandant.  > No more tentacled multi-eyed monstrosities, no foggy fishing towns or ancient aliens posing as gods.

When people appeal to the most obvious tropes of a genre that's definitly richer and more complex, you know they're dumb as hell, or playing so to convey their message.  Sidenote: I should write a paper on that, denouncing the *litteral* rape of the reader when exposed to Lovecraft's work.

Opposing SOMA to HPL is quite dumb though: both explore many of the same topics, but uses different ways of doing so.  It should also be noted that you can easily swap SOMA and HPL work in her critique to get an inverted results that still sound (it doesn't, but it looks like so), due to the lack of examples and actual work.  &#x200B;  > It's proof that not only can existential horror do without Lovecraft's dusty old tropes, it can flourish.

Lots of people loved Princess Diana for example but that wouldn't be ground to let them all come and kiss her. This would be reserved for those who were already close with her.

She does fluff up her hair, but that's done standing behind a curtain which he certainly couldn't see... she kisses a dove on the mouth (yuck!)  and it flies down and lands on his hand...   Honestly, based on body language alone, the dove probably offered more consent cues than Snow did, it blushed so hard the red shone through its white feathers, what a slut!  Snow is beaming as she closes the curtains... but the more I look at that mouth the weirder it looks, could easily be a forced/strained/awkward smile TBH.

            "Acceptability is certainly always subjective, but in common morality I think family members would be upset and find it unacceptable for people who didn't know the deceased to come and kiss them, or to be admitted to their wake at all.  Prince Charming being a character and not a person is not relevant to the ideas being depicted in the story, and there would be a difference in weighing the relationship of a man and woman if comparing a woman inviting a man to sing vs a man interrupting a woman to sing.  Characters obtain imaginary consent the same way people would, just as characters can \"die\" or \"eat\" or \"lift a log\" even though they don't literally do those things since they are not real. I'm not really sure what you're getting upset about here.  Regarding \"beloved\", there is a difference between mutual love and one-sided love, and based solely on the dialogue of the Disney movie, I'm not sure we can say that Snow requited his feelings, though there were certainly hints about it.  I'm not sure what you mean by \"permission\". Reviewing the scene at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlXCHi1FAT4&t=4 he arrives on horse and begins singing and walks down and the traumatized dwarfs pretty much stand there in shock as he walks by them. While they do clear a path by backing up, this is because he was already in the process of making for her.  Factors we should weigh here are (1) he's at least double their height, meaning 8x their weight (2) he's armed with a sword (3) he's clearly a member of the nobility, not to be trifled with. (4) he's young and athletic. How could we expect these halfling elderly obese unarmed gentile subhumans who are in mourning to put up any kind of immediate defense in this situation? They could be paralyzed with fear, or too shocked by his actions to actually process what is happening until he does it.  >So, the, ever, loving, fuck, what? It is a story telling NARRATIVE device. You are projecting your insane worldview onto a CHILDREN'S STORY.  I'm not sure what aspect of my world view you are calling insane. As far as projecting our world views into stories to interpret them, we all do that.  Certainly if we try to imagine the prince with thoughts and personality instead of a THING, it does bring up complex questions which do not occur to us when merely processing him as a plot device when initially watching this as a child.  >Whatever trauma you had in your life ... it is YOUR trauma for YOU to deal with. Insisting that the rest of us adhere to your neurotic worldview is both delusional and hubristic.  I'm really not interested in dwelling upon your tendency to personally insult people. I'm simply saying that based upon what we see, there is not visible grounds to say that the prince had consent for what he did.  There could have been off-camera occurances (these are implied or possible in films all the time) which could have made it acceptabl. We may not have seen all the interactions that PC/SW had, they might have already kissed / fucked / secretly married, she may have told the Dwarves about the prince, etc.  There's no PROOF that this is sexual assault / necrophilia, merely the possibility exists and can't be ruled out by the film alone.  Something lik https://www.alibris.com/Walt-Disneys-Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfs-Junior-Novelization-Walt-Disney-Productions/book/7114229 might include information lacking in the film which could clear up questions people have on how to interpret some things, I wouldn't be able to tell without reading it.  If we go before Disney to http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5314/pg5314.html it went rather differently  >It happened, however, that a king's son came into the forest, and went to the dwarfs' house to spend the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain, and the beautiful Snow-white within it, and read what was written upon it in golden letters. Then he said to the dwarfs, \"Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it.\" But the dwarfs answered, \"We will not part with it for all the gold in the world.\" Then he said, \"Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing Snow-white. I will honour and prize her as my dearest possession.\" As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin.  >And now the King's son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. And it happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which Snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat. And before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was once more alive. \"Oh, heavens, where am I?\" she cried. The King's son, full of joy, said, \"You are with me,\" and told her what had happened, and said, \"I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my father's palace, you shall be my wife.\"  >And Snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding was held with great show and splendour.  In the original tale, my objections are absent. The dwarves are asked, give permission, nothing about the king's son being armed, she wakes up due to accidental dislodging of the apple instead of a kiss. There could still be some elements of coercion with the dwarves, but they are much more active participants and guardians in this case.  The wording of KS (king's son) is rather commanding (\"come with me ... you shall be my wife\") which I'm sure some people would still have a problem with. Snow has a positive reaction (\"was willing\") much as she does in the Disney film, but the issue I think some people have is that one cannot assume the reaction will always be positive to things like kissing/carrying without consent or commanding people to accompany/marry you, even though there are certainly women who enjoy having that done to them.\n",

            "> Do you think the media as a whole, Internet, newspaper, radio and TV portray worse conditions than actually exist?     I think that there are a lot of people who became journalists for the wrong reason, to drive a personal agenda, and that this is leading to a lot of the divisiveness we currently see everywhere.    I'll start with a comparative example, and then draw a parallel to gaming to explain myself:    One prime example would be when CNN posted that vid of Sylville Smith's sister claiming that she was calling for peace.   In reality, she was telling the rioters to \"take that shit to the suburbs, burn their shit down.\"   While CNN ended up posting an apology after having been lambasted for it everywhere, it shouldn't have happened to begin with.    We experience similar things in gaming.   One example would be the firing of two arenanet employees after abysmal behaviour towards customers.   The gaming journalists responded by saying that 'people shouldn't be fired by mob rule.'   Then when Good Old Games published a tweet with the #willnotbeerased hashtag (or however it's written) and shortly after deleted it, those same journalists were calling for the employee that wrote the tweet to be fired.    These kinds of double standards have seemingly become extremely common in journalism as a whole.   Which brings me back to the argument i was making:   \"I think that there are a lot of people who became journalists for the wrong reason, to drive a personal agenda\", these kind of journalists refuse to criticise the side that they emphasize with, and go out of their way to criticize those they consider their opposition over the smallest thing.   As a result, we see a disproportionate amount of claims of sexism, transphobia, homophobia and racism, because to them merely criticising someone who possesses certain immutable traits can only come from hatred of said immutable traits.    > Outside of the competitive scene, players who just genuinely lack skill or time into the game typically see a lot of backlash. My own personal experience was when I started playing Counter strike and league of legends (casual modes)    Just because you aren't playing these games ranked, doesn't mean that the games themselves aren't competitive in nature.    To draw a better comparison you should try to play a game that has both a popular PvP mode and a separate coop mode (against AI).   You' wont get yelled at nearly as much when you are new while playing the coop mode, than you will while playing the PvP mode.   Though there might be one specific exception to this, and that is when you are playing the hardest content in the game, and success depends entirely on every participants contribution.    > When I first started out I was met with a lot of harsh comments followed by being told to uninstall after I just finished the installation. Do you think its sub communities based on specific games that create a narrative of oppression or is it just media?    When they tell you to uninstall the game, it has nothing to do with your gender, skincolour or any other such trait, they just consider you to be really bad at the game.   That said, trashtalking in games **can** be aimed at any such trait, but in most cases that isn't because they actually hate or fear someone over those traits, but because they are trying to get to someone.    Often you'll see that the same person that calls a black guy a nigger in one match will end up calling a white guy a KKK member and a nazi in the next, and then the match after that they'll tell a jew that they'd wished that 'hitler had done a better job'.    This combined with the media's focus on only specific examples of the hostility, and the ability for an obnoxious individual to affect many people at once with their behaviour it's easy to think that this is both widespread and only aimed at specific groups.\n",

Rueda published another study in which they took a sample of 103 young adults and had them solve a \"frustration task.\" Separating the participants into four groups, the researches had one group play no video game, one play a non-violent video game, one play as good guys in a violent game, and one play as bad guys in a violent game.   They found that the games had no impact on aggressive behavior whatsoever, and that **the group which played no game at all was the most aggressive** after the task, whereas **the group that played the violent games were the least hostile and depressed.**    So far there's no evidence that suggests that violent videogames actually make people more violent, but there is an implication that video games (including violent ones) might be making people less violent.\n",

Also, writing comics isn't Zack's career, he has stated that multiple times.  > Basically @EthanVanSciver is, at best, a bully.  Dick Meyer of @DiversityAndCmxis, at best, a bigot who has regularly harassed people online.  Ethan seems like a really nice guy. Ya boi Zack hasn't harassed anyone. I'm still waiting for actual proof, not accusations.   > When a whole lot of people wouldn't do anything at all, Mark tried his best to help. Many times in ways the public never saw. Mark's got my full support. Always.  Okay, I'm done with the support tweets like this. This has nothing to do with the suit, it's just personal opinions of Waid. Moving on.  > These fools feel empowered by the news of the lawsuit.  Just wait until they get hit with the bright red cock of justice!  Lol, what? This tweet will be hilarious if Zack wins.  > \\#IStandWithMarkWaid because he’s the only one with the truth on his side. I look forward to the discovery phase of a trial that his bigoted, abusive opponent will end up paying for.  The truth that he contacted a company he's not associated with to tell them lies about Richard? Still waiting for proof that Zack's a bigot.  Zoe Quinn quote. She's irrelevant, she's writing a book for the Vertigo imprint which died, was revived, and thoroughly shit on. She's not a professional in comics or gaming, just a professional victim.  > Unbelievable that Dick is so delusional and egotistical he can’t see that this is just going show more of his ass.  ...okay? Is this an idiom where Kwanza is from? And I the only one who read that as Richard doing his Kwanza voice?  > \\#IStandWithMarkWaid because it’s not his voice keeping these clowns from careers in comics.  > It’s common sense, decency, and good taste.  How retarded are you? It was Mark Waid's fault. If Richard had no common sense, decency and good taste, Marvel would probably hire him.  > Richard Meyer is a vile racist misogynistic snowflake and his cowardly lawsuit will expose him before the law   Vile? Nope. Racist? Have you heard about his kids? He's definitely not racist. Misogynistic? He hates women so much, he has sex with them! /s He even does videos with his daughter. I'm not seeing the hate. Snowflake? What, does he have preferred pronouns? No? Not a snowflake. Cowardly lawsuit? If there's any cowardice, it's from Waid's actions.  > So expect you all to get requests for all communications and it's now all public. Think no one will hire you now? Wait until all of that is public. Meyers in his hubris just sunk you all. Congrats, you just played yourselves.   What, are you going to dox everyone that supports him, and keep them from getting employed? That sounds like a threat.\n",

Hated so much he felt cheated out of that portion of his life  Yet he and his wife (who loves comic books) are both cautiously optimistic about this show?\n",

I want every second I spent watching Avengers movies back into my life.  Guys, these are *comicbooks* they're suposed to be animated, not live action.

They always seem to do weird faux ye olde Englishe garbage and I can't take that seriously. Even if they turn around and do it for animation and I think it's perfectly awesome  People flipping around and throwing their super hero powers at each other never looks right. Possibly because it's a bit closer to reality and thus harder to suspend disbelief. Maybe that's why Star Wars films never do crazy Force shit like pick up eighteen lightsabers and fuck everyone up or pull somebody inside out  Animation you can get away with that. Plus you never have to worry about anyone getting hurt, or actors getting too old for the role. I imagine a well made animated film is cheaper than paying for the CGI and actors too. And on top of that, well made animation never gets outdated. The Secret of NIMH is older than me and it looks amazing still, whereas if I were to go back and look at the first X-Men film it'd probably look hokey as shit  > *Deadpool exception that proves rule  What about Logan?

            "This seems to a bit of an idiotic topic but there is some merit it in perhaps... though  I have seen anime that does the opposite. I'm not talking about like pointless abuse. Honestly in a lot of anime, they abuse the concept of smacking a guy around because he is a dense fucker and can't knock before entering a bathroom.  This annoys me a bit too but it isn't a monolith. Take Maken-Ki ecchi as fuck anime. That happens to the main dude, he literally forgets because he rooms with a few chicks. Now it's possible to forget, but in a small defense of them. If you forget 24/7 that's being fucking inconsiderate. Secondly this guy does intentionally peep on chicks sometimes, so it's hard for him to claim innocence because sometimes he really *isn't* innocent.  As much as I found inuyasha to be garbage for this, and other reasons, it made a lot more sense in Ranma 1/2. Ranma *went out of his way* to poke at his, somewhat betrothed's, insecurities. Sure people should get over their insecurities but when someone has insecurities about not being feminine enough maybe when you have to live with them you shouldn't tell them like 8 times a day they suck at being a chick. Ranma was a dick to both Akane and other people at least half the time.  Now, on the flip side you have recent shows like konosuba and Aho Girl.  Kazuma right out states he's having none of this bullshit. he will also smack a bitch if he thinks she's being an idiot, not that ti works with darkness cause she's a kinky masochist and gets turned on by that, even when he acts disgusted at her behavior in public and means it. He will routinely tell aqua she is useless and a bitch in public- because she is.  In Aho girl main dude is possibly a bit of a dick but he has lived around the main sex obsessed bitch for his entire life, her precocious ass would routinely do things to him in their childhood that he didn't want to do that might well border on sexual assault, he was too physically weak to stop her. This lead him into gaining more strength, probably mostly just happened because puberty. He now due to her current actions and past actions *knocks the fuck* out of this chick, who is in fact so fucking stupid she routinely gets zeros on all of her tests **all of them**. His aggressive, pretty much assault and battery, treatment of this chick scares everyone around him especially the other chicks, but he just has no more patience for this chick who is selfish, stupid as fuck,inconsiderate, and a **MEGA THOT** obsessed with his dick.  So both extremes exist and largely played for comedy. The chicks doing it to dudes is more common but let's see western media even as a joke try to do some of the dudes not putting up with chicks bullshit. It wouldn't fly- Japan doesn't seem to give a fuck maybe because they don't seem to be as psychotic over there and realize that shit ain't real.\n",
            "Konosuba is an interesting case because everyone in the world except for maybe Vanir is completely fucking useless as an existence, since the whole LN is comedic at its core with a slight slice of romance. For every instance of Kazuma going full Al Bundy on one of his retarded team mates, you also have Kazuma getting killed, eaten, imprisoned, or actually having to fess up to his own bullshit.  It's a world with equality.  Also, the girls actually have redeeming qualities (except for Aqua) and stand by Kazuma when it counts, even if they have severe reservations because it's Kazuma, because he puts up with all the rest of their shit.\n",
            "Yep. It's I guess if you forgive my bard level faggotry, delightfully flawed- or at least it's characters are, and flawed but not shit written characters are the best ones IMO.  Kazuma despite of everything is the most competent in his party by dozens of leagues, because he's the only one that completely controlled by pure whim, and arguably lust. Which sounds hilarious given what a horndog he is, but regardless of how often his \"steal\" ability grants him frilly unmentionables, this is not his intent- it's just a roll of the dice( well his second use when he got megumin's knickers I think he was trying for them- but I think he was going for aqua's because he wanted to humiliate the conceited harpy cunt. He just doesn't get them due to fan theory that I agree with, that she doesn't WEAR any and if they exist his steal ability seems to have a laser guided focus on lady lace, so it went to the target a foot over which was wearing some.  Still, think of it megumin refuses to learn any skills that doesn't buff her explosion magic, it may be because she sees it as the ultimate cool and her race is like cool for it's own sake magical otakus, but given how she behaves talking about her one spell or using it, she seems to *literally* get off on using it- even more suggested by her demand to be able to shoot off one nuke a day even if there isn't anything that needs it- though given her age and the fact she might have just found the puberty fairy(but sadly not the boob fairy) the spell might actually get her off, and unlike what some people claim girls can be just as much(and the more years I live I suspect even MORE)horny than dudes, and given found the awesomeness of explosion orgasms she ain't gonna give that up if she can at all help it. Then there is the wondrous clusterfuck of useless lust that is darkness, which you don't even have to imagine being there- it's shamefully(how appropriate) shown for all the world to see. Who my theory was intentionally gimped her accuracy stats- or might well be *deliberately* missing her strikes because as is shown by vanir when he controls her, she can hit like a mac truck on hate and crack. Well what fun is one shotting monsters when she honestly seems like she'd rather be an adventurer in the goblin slayer universe? She'd rather be taking the hits than giving them. honestly it would make more sense if she just bought a shield and never took a sword with her- then again that might also defeat the *purpose* for her.  In comparison kazuma is going massively into jack of all trades, which usually gimps the fuck out of you in most games- video games anyway, maybe it works better in p&p games where the point is writing a story through your actions so letting you do whatever you want as long as it doesn't fuck with the dm's plot is encouraged. Also given how cripplingly insanely overspecialized the other party members are the only way to save the party is probably for someone to go full utility. Save aqua. Oddly enough she has power and mana and to spare, her idiocy is what makes her useless. That and her spoiled bitchy attitude. Take the frogs, now I dind't know this until someone who may have guessed or it's spelle dout in the other mediums, that the reason she didn't kill the fuck out of it with shit like godblow was because being a **WATER** goddess, even her holy attacks still have a dual element with water. If she wasn't stupid she'd *KNOW* that and not try to directly attack the frogs with spells and just buff or heal kazuma. Fuck she was so stupid when she was smiting the dulahan she didn't seem tot think her smiting/turning didn't have *any* effect on him because it didn't one shot him, despite him rolling on the ground screaming. You'd think she was an earth goddess for how fucking dense she is.  #tookinkytotorture #itisn'trapeifyouwantit\n",

            "I have no comment on any of the articles written about the presentation, because I didn't read them. I formed my opinion by reading the presentation itself. I disagree with this video's assessment that the presentation isn't as bad as it's made out to be.  The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner [is acceptable](https://imgur.com/Q4vdZAl) provided the rules and effects are clear, is  [politically neutral, and focused on tone](https://imgur.com/rk9BYjJ), They see the platform owners as \"[hospitality organizers](https://imgur.com/WVShVvU)\". I reject these premises. For one, I don't see google/twitter/facebook any more a \"hospitality organizer\" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.  Secondly, these providers [already see themselves as politically neutral](http://archive.is/ExxVO) and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term [\"illegal aliens\"](http://archive.is/Xe0AC) (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision). Or the infamous \"gender pronouns\" debate. If I call a M2F transgender person \"he\", is that \"tone\" (and subject to censorship), \"political\" (and not subject to censorship), or a giant grey area subject to the whims of the censor and how they feel about me and/or the subject on any given day?  Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said \"I hate these guys and want them off my site\". When Alex Jones was deplatformed there were news articles and official statements on standby to tell us why it happened. When has such transparency ever answered more questions than it raised? You're still trying to polish the turd that is highly subjective standards with the shine of \"policy\" and \"procedure\".  Fourthly, what if I don't want these platforms to \"police tone\"? So far they have a shit track record in policing their platforms; why should I trust them in the future? Earlier the presentation poses the question \"by what right do you do this?\". They try to answer it by saying \"well we'll only focus on tone\", but the question remains: \"by what right are you the arbiter of 'tone'?\"  Fifthly, if there is a problem with \"tone\", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it? Why not empower the users with more advanced tools to filter things themselves (or for others with their consent) without removing the \"offensive\" material from the platform. Filter lists and moderated feeds could be services provided by users, for users and under the total control (including the ability to modify filter lists, opt-in/out of them, and ultimately disable all filtering/moderation) of the end-user. That way people can tailor their experience to suit their own sensibilities rather than having one standard thrust onto everyone.  Finally, I love the use of \"family friendly\" terms. When Germany censors things it's to [\"make online spaces safer\"](https://imgur.com/9G9oAju), but when \"dictatorial leaders\" want to do so it's to [\"improve their methods of control\"](https://imgur.com/VHMwhT1). And on the [page](https://imgur.com/sejtdVp) where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.\n",
            ">The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner is acceptable provided the rules and effects are clear, is politically neutral, and focused on tone,   Some moderation exists on every virtual platform that I'm aware of. The point that Insights is making is that you have to identify what your moderation is going to be and effectively communicate it without taking a political bias as a platform. That's entirely reasonable.   >They see the platform owners as \"hospitality organizers\".   That's just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: \"People are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to\". This means that they are saying that users want to understand what is *supposed* to be their standard of conduct, rather than just what *isn't* their standard of conduct.  >For one, I don't see google/twitter/facebook any more a \"hospitality organizer\" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.  These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are *private* communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which *even the police* are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds. Public comments on a public platform to engage in a public conversation are going to be totally different and have completely different moderation. I'm not even convinced it would be *legal* for Goggle to moderate your email.  >Secondly, these providers already see themselves as politically neutral and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term \"illegal aliens\" (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision).  The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies *haven't been*. Google's failure to learn isn't a problem with the report.  >Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said \"I hate these guys and want them off my site\".   Transparency helps when the rules are consistent. That's the point. You have to do both, that's why both are recommended. What happened with GoDaddy is an inconsistency of the application of rules, not a lack of transparency. If GoDaddy were to be consistent and transparent, they should have a rule that states: \"GoDaddy reserves the right to remove your domain, without notice, at any time, because the CEO doesn't like you.\"  >Fourthly, what if I don't want these platforms to \"police tone\"?   Tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. It's why you can't just run up to someone and start screaming \"FAGGOT!!!!\" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them. *Some* boundary exists for tone. The point that Insights is making is that you should be policing tone *and not content*. SCOTUS does the same thing with the first amendment. It's why the government is not allowed to engage in \"viewpoint discrimination\", but is allowed to arrest you for disorderly conduct if you won't stop screaming.  >Fifthly, if there is a problem with \"tone\", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it?  They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.  Is fifthly a word?...  >When Germany censors things it's to \"make online spaces safer\", but when \"dictatorial leaders\" want to do so it's to \"improve their methods of control\".

            "> Some moderation exists on every virtual platform that I'm aware of.  Moderation doesn't require that content be removed. Slashdot for example, despite having moderation, never removed any comments. It just hid them from default view, but you could always browse at -1 if you really wanted to see the GNAA or goatse comments (along with a handful of well-written comments expressing unpopular views).  > That's just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: \"People are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to\".  I disagree that this is something that should be the responsibility of the people who run the platform.

Your emails are private communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which even the police are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds.  Usenet is perhaps a better example because it is a public forum that employs a similar model of moderation to email. The ISP Usenet servers oftentimes filtered spam and the binary groups, but the posts themselves weren't removed from the system; so you could usually pay for access to servers that didn't filter. And while some groups were moderated, others weren't; and the moderated groups maintained their own rules. If you preferred to read the unmoderated groups, a client-side killfile provided crude means for user-controlled filtering.  Usenet's technical considerations aside, I think modern platforms would get less push-back if they adopted/improved upon that approach to moderation: the platform just serves you the messages, lets you post, and provides tools for users and groups to moderate as they see fit without global posting guidelines. If something is actually illegal (in the \"forward to the FBI upon removal\" sense), or a court orders its removal, then the admins can pull it.  > The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies haven't been. Google's failure to learn isn't a problem with the report.  Perhaps not, but it may suggest that being politically neutral is one of those things that sounds easy but in practice is really hard or impossible.  > Tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. It's why you can't just run up to someone and start screaming \"FAGGOT!!!!\" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them.  True, but I might be able to run up to a friend and do that without being hit. Are tech platforms able to make that sort of distinction? So far they haven't done so, either because they don't want to, because it's a hard problem for the AI systems they're using, or because the content being flagged is being reviewed by someone who doesn't understand the context well enough to make the distinction.  > They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.

The platform administrators should concern itself with things that destabilize the platform, and provide tools so the users themselves can control the content they see.  That doesn't really effect the report either.  Again, it doesn't say *how* to establish moderation. Just that people want to know what the rules are. Using your way, people would certainly understand what the rules are because they would be the ones moderating it.  >Usenet is perhaps a better example...  I don't think this really addresses anything.  >Perhaps not, but it may suggest that being politically neutral is one of those things that sounds easy but in practice is really hard or impossible.  To be *perfectly* politically neutral, like being *perfectly* objective is very hard. However, it isn't an impossible feat to get within less than 1 standard deviation of neutral.   >True, but I might be able to run up to a friend and do that without being hit. Are tech platforms able to make that sort of distinction? So far they haven't done so, either because they don't want to, because it's a hard problem for the AI systems they're using, or because the content being flagged is being reviewed by someone who doesn't understand the context well enough to make the distinction.  Tech platforms are not your friends. No institution is capable of emotion or affiliation. My extreme example is meant to demonstrate that tone policing *must* occur in any social environment, either by an authority, or the individuals involved.  >They say that in context of changing their rules over time. I didn't see anything in reference to suggesting allowing have control over moderation.  I agree that they don't say that users have control over moderation. It's that users make demands over time that have to be accommodated, justifying changing the rules when necessary to accommodate those demands.\n",

            "I feel suicidal a lot, too.   Your story sounds a lot like mine, and many others I have heard. Especially the bits about thinking its a good idea to put women on a pedestal. Unfortunately, the 'nice guy' is only a working bit if the girl is 100% mentally sound AND past-wall. And even then, you get coin flip odds that she dips out; maybe financially raping you in the process. Funny how, we provide them stability, love, acceptance. Love that is basically unconditional as it can possibly be: \"Dont be a cheating whore\" and its too fucking much to ask. Modern women are fucked up beyond belief. Facebook / Dating apps / Main Stream Media and just life in general, for whatever reason, ends up producing a lot of disgusting women. Its not even that we should judge them or look down on them for being hypergamous, dating up and across hierarchies. I cant hold something you cant help against you. What I can hold against you is being a cheating whore, like many women are; and are absolutely capable of NOT being. Too many girls choose to have a weak mind. To cop the fuck out of responsibility, and to let things progress in ways they know they shouldnt. I wonder how many of these cheating whores end up blowing it on 1 too many 'good men' before they slam into the wall at 90 MPH, never to see a second glance from a man ever again.   And how fucked up is it that, even though I \"HATE\" my ex and the things that she did to me, and the way she treated me despite my endless kindness and respect; some bit of me still loves her and longs for her. I wish so fucking bad that I had never met this succubus and her constant manipulations and beating phrases into my head still has my brain hooked. It sucks.   And what a crock of shit it is that the 'standard' is for people in relationships to just THROW this word \"love\" around like even 1 single percent of women even have the capacity to love the man they are with without constantly looking for trade-up possibilities and encounters they can cop the fuck out of. How 100% uninvested they can be when they tell you GARBAGE like 'were a good *family*' or 'I love you' or 'I choose you' or '(referring to animals) you make a good dad'. Sooo fucked. Where Im from that word \"Love\" actually meant something. My parents were from that magical time when there was actually incentive and a social standard to find someone loyal and be with them. Not be a cheating whore and dip the fuck out of any responsibility for your actions like many modern women. How fucking sick is it that someone would tell you they care about you using a 100/100 power word, and at the same time be literally ZERO PERCENT invested in your relationship, or even at the very least not emotionally cheating on you or physically cheating on you. TF is the 'right' answer to a woman telling you they love you, if you are average in any way? \"Sureeeeeee you do.\" And why would a woman NOT use the strongest, most manipulating words possible; especially when seeing the power they have on men. They see that shit everywhere. Society beats it into their heads like a fucking drum.  Makes me remember those retarded as fuck 'I love you more' battles I would have with my exes. Funny how both girls I used to do that with turned into cheating whores. \"I love you more\" my DICK.  Try to find beauty in different places. Its helped me a lot. Like, the clean air when it rains; a good sunset, cliche things.  And, IMO, if you like gaming at all make sure you have a gaming computer :D. Dont be a console pleb XD  Delete the facebook.

            "No Nut November has recently begun, and I'm sure many of you reading are participating along with myself. In the years past I have been hailed as a champion - for 7 straight years I have spent November as a chastitised christian. I hoped to continue this legacy. And last night, I failed.  One as regal as I, failing? Impossible. Only the gods could achieve such power to stop me. I guess that night I was dealing with a god.  I'm on the YouTube homepage, trying to find some epic Morgz videos, when I stumble upon a certain video. This damn video. Its bright thumbnail, its captivating title - it utterly fascinated me. This cursed video: it was none other than “Fortnite's most EPIC event EVER!”, posted by the one and only Ali A.  My body immediately began to shake, and my penis shot straight up. The most EPIC event EVER? What could it be? I felt a pull towards the video like I had never felt before. It took me awhile to realize the effect the video was having on me. I fell back in my chair in fear. In agony. In complete and utter despair.  My hand instinctively grabbed the mouse and began to slowly slide over to the thumbnail. I kicked and screamed and cried, trying and failing to stop my body. Sweat was dripping down my entire body. Minutes later, the pointer had finally reached its destination. And with a cry, the hand that didn't feel like mine anymore clicked.  I was immediately met with a scream. “THIS IS IT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!” Purple light streamed from the computer monitor and began to fill the room. The voice on the screen continued talking, seemingly in an ancient tongue. My entire body began to quiver as something awakened inside of me. My speakers began to shake as something inside of them grew louder. Was this music? Or was this something else?  The music finally picked up, and immediately, as Ali's intro began, I came harder and faster than I ever had before. The sensation rendered me unconscious. The last thing I remember seeing that night was my cum streaked over his face. And it looked like he was smiling.  I woke up to a rising sun. My clothes were back on, my sweat was wiped away, and my penis was flaccid. I could finally see again. Was this all a dream? No, there’s no way. It felt too real.  My suspicions were immediately crushed as I looked to the monitor. In a drunk stupor, it looks like I had changed my desktop background to a picture of him. He was staring into my heart - into my soul. And he was covered in my cum.  So, guys, whatever you do, don’t watch Ali A's newest video. Anybody less powerful than I would surely be dead. Stay safe this November - deny Fortnite.\n",

            "Then again, what makes you say feminists are automatically right?

It's not like we are talking about a group that exists therefore is right.\n",
            "I didn't say they're automatically right.. I said that they're right in this situation. The message of The Little Mermaid is quite literally to give up absolutely everything that you are in order to find \"the perfect man\". Ironically the original fairytale had the exact opposite message, to learn to be comfortable with who you are instead of relying on other people to make you happy. Cinderella was again about how you aren't worthy until you change your appearance and demeanor.  What's funny is something like Aladdin which was a gender swap of the same premise, ultimately ended with the message being not to lie, but instead to be yourself.  Beauty and the Beast was about legit stockholme syndrome. Fall in love with abusive assholes just because it's better than being single. The hardworking Gaston is considered an ass for all of his negative traits, the Beast, whose accomplishments are a result of birth-rite, does all of the exact same negative shit, but he's considered a good guy.  What shocks me is feminists who don't spot these glaring problems, but instead blindly support Disney. \"The Force is Female\" is a marketing slogan, not a philosophy. And where did you get your \"ACTUAL\" feminists? You're talking about extremists. Extremists are never a good thing and are almost always a minority. For every Andrea Dworkin there are 20 non-vocal, even-tempered feminists. For every Roosh-V there are 20 normal non-sexist MRAs.\n",
            "How many stories are about men giving up everything and risking it all for being with the perfect woman, protecting her, caring about her, etc.? I'm not saying it should be the rule of law, but for many people that's how they want to be and how they are. Now you will say because muh society, but it has always been that way. You don't have to like it. But if you deny that risking everything for love is something people do, then you are being disingenuous.   With Cinderella you should also consider that the prince loved her even when he found out what she really was. Like you can't ignore the fact they had no chance at meeting otherwise.      Aladdin is completely different, though. He literally created a whole, complex lie with stories made up of his deeds. Like there is a whole song of the Genie going around and saying outright lies about him. He created a whole new persona, while Cinderella just went to the ball.      Belle only started liking the Beast once he started being nicer. She hated and feared him when he was mean. Girl kept trying to get away from him. It's again, disingenuous to say she fell in love with him.    Both him and Gaston started out as dickbags, but the Beast was willing to work on himself and become a much better person. Gaston, even to his last moment was an aggressive person and refused to listen to Belle. Even with Maurice, while the Beast imprisoned him at first, he exchanged him for Belle, then also let even her go when Maurice was ill.    To me one of the big themes of the movie is how you can change, better yourself and set things right if you try. (I think one song in the movie even has lyrics along those lines.)       The feminists I talked about? Elizabeth Cady Stanton   > Elizabeth Cady Stanton (November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902) was an American suffragist, social activist, abolitionist, and leading figure of the early women's rights movement. Her Declaration of Sentiments, presented at the Seneca Falls Convention held in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, is often credited with initiating the first organized women's rights and women's suffrage movements in the United States.[1][2] Stanton was president of the National Woman Suffrage Association from 1892 until 1900.        Sally Miller Gearhart    > Sally Miller Gearhart (born April 15, 1931) is an American teacher, feminist, science-fiction writer, and political activist.[1] In 1973, she became the first open lesbian to obtain a tenure-track faculty position when she was hired by San Francisco State University, where she helped establish one of the first women and gender study programs in the country.[2] She later became a nationally known gay rights activist.      And Andrea Dworkin, whom I probably don't have to introduce at all.   Conveniently, she is the only one who is considered a radical feminist, though not at all a little fringe no-name nobody.    Please, do the typical thing and declare that the biggest of big name organisers or feminism are totally not actual feminists. Because YOU know what feminism REALLY is about, somehow Emmeline Pankhurt (suffragette and also white feather movement supporter), Germaine Greer (influential second-waver and also supporter of female-on-male pedophilia) or Marion Zimmer Bradley (celebrated feminist fantasy author and habitual incestuous child rapist) were not real. None of them actually are, just you.\n",

Establishing that good things will only happen for you when you literally give up on who you are is damaging. What I literally said is that they're not wrong to say that Disney has pushed some pretty sexist messages in their media in an attempt to profit. They care about women's right about as much as Obama. Hint: They don't, they just like to talk about it.\n",
            "> What I literally said is that they're not wrong to say that Disney has pushed some pretty sexist messages  Or they are movies in which people like you decide to read sexist messages into. People read into pieces of art the things that they want to see. That's why great works are always so discussed and analyzed. Everybody has a different perspective. Unless Disney explicitly says what their message is, it's just your interpretation being imposed on them.\n",
            "I just said this to someone else, but.... Disney princess movies are advertised to extremely young children. Not middle aged women. A middle aged woman somehow being manipulated by some shitty disney movie probably has more to worry about than \"the big bad media\". A 6 year old though? Her first interpretation of male/female relationships is one of pure fantasy. Generally speaking boys at the same age are watching adventure movies/shows like Transformers, Ninja turtles or Pokemon. They're about making friends, having a good time and being morally right. Shows advertised to girls(at least back in the 80s-90s) are generally about finding the right guy.\n",
            ">Disney princess movies are advertised to extremely young children. Not middle aged women.  So? Kids who watch Superman don't usually try to jump off the roof with a towel around them.

            "I'm certain I could find a ton of stories of kids being stupid with makeshift capes. That's not the point though. The point is that kids absolutely do want to emulate Superman's morals. They use those stories as a way of determining how they act around others. A story about a very fantastical interaction is going to create an idea of fantasy. I'm sure little girls want to become mermaids, the same as boys want to become superman, the difference is interpersonal relationships.  Generally speaking a familial relationship is viewed entirely differently. A kid generally doesn't watch their parents go on dates, they don't watch their parents fall in love. Even those with a broken household still aren't sitting in on their mother's date with suitor #2. The nuance of attraction is being simulated with camera work and sound in movies and tv shows.  Kids are attracted to colors, not so much stories. Designing a story with pink colours but doesn't feature a relationship is absolutely doable and I don't think people take issue with it. It's the shows that are pink in colour and are pushing some tumultuous, romantic subplot that become a problem. Boy Meets World is about a kid, his brother and best friend screwing around. Season 3 introduces a romantic subplot that's treated in a fairly healthy way throughout the rest of the series. Girl Meets World is about a girl and her best friend dealing with dramatic relationships right from day 1.\n",

He's fucking with education funding which was the last thing we need right now. And his border policies while an improvement are mired in scandals because even he's not sure how to follow through on this in an ethical way.

Instead we got a surprisingly decent president in spite of it all. I'll be voting for him again next time around.  He's doing a good job. Let's no kid ourselves.

I simply decided out of my own to focus on myself rather than waste money on girls and dating. When I actually went on dates I had some rules I religiously followed.  - Make sure you can have fun alone on the date if she doesnt show up or simply dont like each other. For example watch a movie you will like regardless if you are with company. - Think how much you would spend alone, if the date goes well you can increase the amount but only if she agrees to be the one paying the second time. - Kisses and sex early, if she wants to wait for whatever reason its ok, dont push it. The best way to not push it is to stop dating. - Make sure she knows you dont want an stable relationship in a natural way. she will bring the subject 'casually' so just answer equally 'casually'. - Spend at least the same time and money on fun as you spend improving yourself, fun includes fun alone and dating.  I have many good stories to tell on how I learned and applied each lesson, maybe will sometime.  I dont date anymore because I am living with a girl who doesnt want to get married and knows I will literally flee the country if she tries to nail me. She also has an extreme case of tokophobia https://www.fearof.net/fear-of-pregnancy-phobia-tokophobia/ and she would literally gag if she sees a pregnant woman so pregnancy is less likely.

I don't think you find such state in G, Wing, Turn A or 00, maybe cases could be made for AGE, Reconguista in G or Iron-Blooded Orphans I haven't completed them so I don't know but even if so that still plenty of series that lack such states which makes saying \"almost always\" a bit much.    >Legend of the Galactic Heroes, a Japanese novel series adapted into multiple anime shows, also contains a similar government called the Galactic Empire.

People were expected to check their feelings, get a thick skin, and have a higher priority than being upset at a criticism or a telling-off. Now it turns out that Torvalds was willing to be a cunt only as long as he wasn't upsetting the right people, and that the importance of the project wasn't really paramount at all. It was just that, until now, no one else (no group, no political affiliation) was sufficiently important to restrain himself regarding.

            "Prosecutors have decided not to charge Long Beach Councilwoman Jeannine Pearce with domestic violence or driving under the influence in connection with a June clash with her former chief of staff.  But a district attorney’s memo detailing the decision also raises questions about the Long Beach Police Department’s response to the June 3 incident involving the councilwoman and Devin Cotter.  In its initial statement, the Police Department said it received a call for assistance from the California Highway Patrol about a possible drunk driving incident on the shoulder of the 710 Freeway in Long Beach at 2:40 a.m.  The city’s officers smelled alcohol on Pearce, who admitted to drinking that night, according to the district attorney’s memo. A field sobriety test conducted about 4 a.m. showed she was mildly impaired.  But the memo said a test of the councilwoman’s blood-alcohol level was not conducted until 4:20 a.m., nearly two hours after the CHP called. At that point, the test showed Pearce had a blood-alcohol level of 0.06%, under the legal limit of 0.08%, the memo said.  The testing device used on Pearce was unreliable, the prosecutor’s memo said. A department toxicologist had recommended it not be used a month before the incident. Additional tests were not performed, according to the district attorney’s memo.  A police spokesman said in a statement that officers initially investigated whether domestic violence had occurred when they arrived, interviewing Cotter and Pearce before realizing that the councilwoman had been drinking. At that point, the officers called for a colleague who is a certified drug recognition expert to investigate, Sgt. Brad Johnson said in the statement.  He said the testing device had been “tagged to be replaced but was not removed from its storage cabinet. The officer who retrieved the device did not realize ... and unfortunately used it during the DUI investigation.”  Police at the scene saw Cotter with swelling, redness and a cut to his head and cuts to his hand, according to the district attorney’s memo. Pearce at one point had shoved Cotter, causing him to fall to the ground, the memo said.  Prosecutors ultimately decided that Pearce, who was elected to the City Council in 2016, could argue she was defending herself when she shoved Cotter.  In an email to The Times, Pearce said Cotter had thrown her “keys, iPad, and many other things” off to the side of the road during the argument on the freeway shoulder. Asked about the delay in time between the arrival of responding officers and the administering of a sobriety test, Pearce said she was questioned about the confrontation with Cotter for “some time” while the investigators were “waiting on someone that was bringing the Breathalyzer.”  Cotter, who could not be reached for comment, served as campaign manager for Mayor Robert Garcia when he was elected in 2014 and later served as a legislative deputy to him until July 2016, according to Cotter’s LinkedIn page. He then left to work as Pearce’s chief of staff until February 2017. Pearce and Cotter had “dated before, during and after” the June 3 incident, according to the district attorney’s memo.  The two had been driving back from a concert, where both had been drinking, when the altercation occurred, according to the memo. An argument ensued, and Pearce struck Cotter on the arm because he was “causing the car to dangerously swerve” on the freeway, the memo said.  Both gave “multiple inconsistent statements and thus both have proved to be inaccurate reporters of fact,” Deputy Dist. Atty. Janis Johnson wrote in the memo. But evidence supported the councilwoman’s final version of the events over Cotter’s, Johnson concluded.  Among the evidence was a text message Pearce sent to her new chief of staff asking for help and a video the councilwoman took that showed Cotter yelling a threat to release disparaging information about her to “the press, her husband and her employer if she did not meet certain demands while holding her car keys,” Johnson wrote.  Long Beach police previously said officers did not find “sufficient cause” to arrest either Pearce or Cotter at the scene. Pearce was driven home by a friend, according to police, and Cotter was taken home by the responding officers.  Cotter tried to confront Pearce again hours later outside her home, the councilwoman said. He was arrested on suspicion of public intoxication a short time later, according to police.  In a statement released earlier this year, Pearce said she had been the victim of domestic violence in the months before the incident and that police were investigating, though she did not accuse anyone by name.  “Since late last year I have experienced escalating threats, harassment and stalking,” she wrote.  Pearce said those incidents remain under investigation by Long Beach police, and she declined to elaborate Thursday. She also expressed frustration that she had been cast as the aggressor in the incident.  “I find it frustrating that as the one that called [police], that was trapped, and was faced with fear that I was listed as the only suspect in the matter. This is one example of the challenges for women (and even men) in speaking up about psychological abuse,” Pearce wrote in the email. “The burden of proof is not a bruise on the outside, ones easily seen.”  Pearce has said she was not “pulled over” June 3, but had requested a police presence at the scene. Earlier this year, CHP’s Southern Division Chief Chris O’Quinn told The Times that his officers came upon Pearce and Cotter because they were involved in a “heated argument” on the side of the freeway.  Long Beach officers have closed their investigation into the June 3 incident, according to a statement released Wednesday. The district attorney’s Public Integrity Division is still conducting a separate investigation into “alleged inappropriate activity and conflicts of interest” in connection with the incident. A spokesman for the district attorney’s office declined to elaborate.\n",

This is going far beyond merely saying he had unsavory opinions. The argument is that *every single Lovecraftian trope is unavoidably tainted and carries within it Lovecraft's own misogyny/homophobia/racism*. Everything good about Lovecraft, the article argues, is evident in the works of previous authors.  The implication is inherently censorious. Not only is Lovecraft to be removed from the canon, but *nothing that feels too Lovecraftian* (in aesthetics or tone) can be permitted.  Not only that, Lovecraft is attacked for \"grossly simplifying\" \"mental illness\" but that just shows absolute stupidity about Lovecraft's depiction. Lovecraft wasn't depicting mental illness or \"actual\" insanity. Legally speaking, insanity is a complete break from reality, but in Lovecraft-land *people in mental asylums are closer to reality than the rest of us*.   This is an atrocious demand. The analogue would be that, because Tolkein had some unsavory opinions that influenced his writing, the entire genre of fantasy must abolish the use of orcs, elves, dwarves, etc.   They're going far beyond merely \"critically discussing\" the work of previous authors.

His stories are the ones that got rooted in our culture. Anyone saying to ignore his contributions or claim they're \"boring\" because he was a racist is lying to themselves.\n",
            "No, *a few* of Lovecraft’s stories had the kind of themes that suggest inspiration from his fear of miscegenation. *The Shadow Over Innsmouth*, *Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and his Family*, and if you really reach you can fit *The Dunwich Horror* in there too. You also have some nakedly discriminatory stuff in *The Street* and *The Horror at Red Hook*, which even Lovecraft was like “these are garbage why did I write these”. Outside of that the *most* you can find is the cat’s name in *The Rats in the Walls*, and a few references to “mongrel” folk peppered in other stories or usage of words like “negro” (outside of his rather infamous poem *On the Creation of Niggers*). There’s so much of his work, some of his best even, that has *none* of that stuff, like *At the Mountains of Madness*, *The Colour Out of Space*, *The Outsider*, *The Whisperer in Darkness*, *The Statement of Randolph Carter*, *Dagon*, most of his Dreamlands stuff — the idea that racism was one of the primary driving themes of Lovecraft’s work is a lie being spread by writers who want to brand it politically incorrect so they can discard it unread and force people to read their propagandistic slop.  Lovecraft’s key influences that pervade his work stem from his *nihilism*. That’s the overarching philosophy that infects most of it, not his racial politics which only surface in about 10% of his output.\n",
            "The thing is, pretty much everyone back then used the word \"negro\" for black people- pretty much irregardless of race or how racist they were.  Anyway, the primary driving force for his work was probably the nightmares he had as a kid and the fact he was ill a lot if anything.\n",
            "Right? Like there was a time when calling someone *black* was insulting, and \"negro\" was the preferred term. So I think it's patently unfair to call that terminology in his work \"racist.\"  Likewise, people get so weird about the cat being named \"Nigger Man\" but IDK. It's a little racist but also, 1923 was a really different time, and I didn't really see a lot of *spite* behind the name, just kind of a tongue-and-cheek cat name that reflected the racial attitudes of the era.  Sometimes Lovecraft threw out some racist stuff, but even in most even-minded communities, I think it gets a lot more attention than it deserves.\n",
            "Lovecraft wasn't just racist, he was very xenophobic. It wasn't like he was accepting of all people who happened to have pale skin.   But he also had a very isolated upbringing (father died in a sanitarium, mother was overbearing and eventually died in the same sanitarium) and he was plagued by nightmares and sleeping problems throughout his life. I feel bad for him, but he seems like yet another example of troubled minds leading to great works of creativity.  It's a shame he died so young, who knows how much he could have accomplished if he'd lived another 30 years?\n",
            "I often argue that Lovecraft's horror works because he had racist views, in this case a strong hierarchy.  It's really logical, you take a position where you see some people as subhumans and therefore your right is to do as please regardless of what they think, like you don't consider the opinion of animals.  Now what happens to you when something new appears and is higher than you in that hierarchy? You expect the same treatment as you have considered to those beneath you. Alien plants dissecting humans and dogs and not showing any signs that they think humans somehow higher beings as the dogs, now that's scary and completely within that world view.\n",
            "People know what the latin word for \"black\" is, right?\n",
            "Let's be honest, Lovecraft's more racist works haven't endured nearly as much as the ones that display little to no racism. Pick up a Lovecraft anthology today and you'd have a relatively low likelihood of finding *The Street* or *Horror at Red Hook* in there, but you're almost certain to get *Call of Cthulhu* and *Mountains of Madness*.\n",
            ". \t\t\t\tI mean it depends on the anthology, because usually if it’s Lovecraft’s own work only then it will be a reprint of one of the Arkham House collections, and those are consistent in their contents (specifically both stories are in *Dagon and Other Macabre Tales*).  But if it’s a mix of Lovecraft and other writers or if the collection’s edited by someone else then yeah, *The Street* is pretty much always passed up, it’s generally agreed to be one of his worst flops. You’ll find it in complete collections and in the appropriate Arkham House volume and nowhere else. *Red Hook* has a lot of problems but it sees a bit more press, as it has a few redeeming aspects (and Alan Moore included an homage to it in *Providence*) but yeah it’s never going to be on anyone’s A-list or B-list.  *The Shadow Over Innsmouth* has the miscegenation angle but also works on a lot of other levels, it’s the kind of story that’s so great it runs well beyond what the author intended. It resonates at a fundamental level, hence its fame.\n",

Remember the time when you had to find that womans pan and how silly the mission was. I feel like that kind of stuff can really breath life into long serious tales. It's the reason the stuff is in pretty much everything of a similar nature. GoT has gotten a bit over the top with it lately, but early seasons featured a great example of how to intersperse comedy throughout a serious drama to keep it from feeling too intense. Not saying AC is up to either of those examples' caliber, but it's the same concept.\n",

Seems kind of silly to be offended by a joke about a meme in the subtext of a random NPC in a game about a dude who uses DNA to relive his ancestor's life in a fantasy reimagining of Rome... I haven't played the game so I can't exactly say the tone of it, but I wouldn't imagine it's that much different from other Assassins Creeds which always had a level of levity about them, especially lately.

            "Generally I think even dumb impeachment must be voted on in the Senate. But the \"court\" doesn't need to last very long. Basically if the chief justice who runs the \"court case\" wants to get this over with he can make the whole process happen in a single day.   Though Robert's will probably treat it seriously which mean no fast trial but also no bullshit from the dems either. The evidence will be heard and the witnesses called and delaying tactics and grandstanding will be shutdown. Then after closing statements the Senate will vote and it will be over.   Since the odds that 2/3rds of the Senate that is mostly Republican and who thinks this whole Russian thing is bullshit the chances of a convention are so low that they would need to take Trumps mask off scoobydo style to reveal literally Putin to have any chance to get those votes.  Further its really only a card the dems can play once. Since afterwards they can't go after Trump anymore and they look like they just wasted a lot of time.   So basically if the impeach him they will lose big in 2020 but there is also a small chance they uncover a proverbial smoking gun and remove him from office. Though chance of that is very low.  So my guess is they just threaten impeachment but never actually do it. They know it's a bullshit claim that sounds even worse when put under the spotlight.\n",

Obviously it’ll be a complete waste of time, because there’s zero chance of 67 Senators voting to convict. But it has to happen.\n",

Its in the same sort of a place as a highly touted first round draft pick of your favorite sports franchise is after the GM and the Coach who drafted him have gotten fired.  Think Current  Lakers' Head Coach / Dead Man Walking Luke Walton.    The sign-up numbers for CBS all-access are bad.  They went down significantly after STD came out (according to an extrapolation by the video in the OP).  My Comic Book Store Guy is fond of saying this about digital comics.  For over a decade now, everyone in comics has been told that digital is the wave of the future and that paper and ink don't have long to live.  Yet, every single month, the digital outlets call my CBSG and try to convince him to hawk their products.  As my CBSG is fond of saying, if you don't know what the numbers are for digital comic sales (and no one does) that means they're bad, because if they were good, you would never hear the end of it and those sales numbers would be highly publicized.    If you're not hearing CBS talk at great length about exactly how strong CBS all-access growth is, that means the numbers are dismal, because if the numbers were good, they would never stop talking about it.  Now, it appears the first five episodes of STD season 2 went way over budget, because what was screened was received horribly and reshoots were ordered.  Think Justice League, think Solo: A star wars story.    Now, Les Moonves, who was the champion of STD at CBS, and those who are loyal to him on the board, are out.  CBS can cancel STD and Moonves takes the entire blame, and the new board gets to write it off.  The leadership that backed STD being gone removes the Sunk Cost Fallacy for eliminating this piece of trash.  The new Picard series (which I'm not yet sure how I feel about) being fast-tracked provides a replacement possibility.    The shorts were made to be sold to distributors as a way to generate some cash to cover STD's losses.

In my opinion All Men Are Like That just as much as All Women Are Like That.  The differences you're pointing out come from women that are raised in good environments or realize early on that their nature will poison their lives. These women actively go against their nature, often because of deeply held religious belief, to avoid hypergamy and a whole slew of other issues. However, they are *just like other women*. They have the same desires, fears, and urges.  This is why sometimes previously steady women go haywire. Let me give an example (I apologize for the excessive background, but without background the example makes no sense).   I'm Mormon. We have deeply held religious beliefs that are often seen as insane or unreasonable. We also have a leadership (at local levels) that is selected entirely from members of the congregation. The women's organization (Relief Society) has a president that is selected from the most faithful women in the congregation, and must meet very specific requirements. For example, she must be married and a full tithe payer (gives 10% of her income or her family's income to the church each year). This requires a certain amount of dedication. The bishop of each congregation has similarly stringent requirements.  One of the most common issues in the church is affairs between the relief society president and the bishop. These are both deeply religious people that believe in the sanctity of marriage, but the circumstances in which they work together plays towards the darker side of human nature. Women love being with a powerful man.  I've seen women that have 5 children and have been married for 15 years throw it all away for a quick fling with the bishop.

Do you think any guy in that situation is not going to be scared when, if they are even moderately informed about how such events normally proceed in today's society, they know that   a) if they stick around, the physical confrontation is likely to escalate and literally any injury on that aggressive woman is going to be seen with extreme prejudice against him by police and the system. The larger and stronger he is, the more he is going to be presumed to be at fault. If he defends himself in any way, like even just block her flailing, the police are very likely to believe him to be the aggressor even in cases where his bruises are obviously defensive. And god forbid the drunk woman trips herself up during - good luck proving it wasn't him that pushed her down.  b) if they manage to extricate themselves and leave, there is a good chance that the physical altercation will still get police involved and their investigation is going to start with the woman's story as primary source and by the time they get to him will be just as biased.  >You aren't taking the historical context into account.  actually, they are..

If these whiny faggots had any marbles left, they'd at least try to co-opt Lovecraft, claim that his work was self-criticism of the man's own biases (which they were), and how people can be reformed if someone reaches out and offers to be a helping hand.

            "Ok, serious question here. I'm im my late 20s. Back when I was in highschool, the school I went to probably had about 400 seniors on a given year. I knew a good chunk of the people who were in my grade, and only 2 of them were openly gay. I'm sure there were a lot more gay people who just didn't want to come out or were just still figuring things out, but I guess my point is that nobody went around pretending they were a celestial being, or a dog, or had a gender that was neither male or female.  Reading some of these stories, it's as if all that bullshit is basically the new fad now and in any given class of 30, you have 5 nonbinary kids, 7 gay kids, and 4 transgenders. Is this just made up bullshit, or are kids really falling for that crap? I'm not saying that all of them are phonies, but in the OP, it seems there are at least 3 queer people and one asexual person... That seems like a bit too much and I'd guess that if these stories are true, a lot of it is just rebelious teenager type thing...  Edit: Typo... Late 20s, not 30s. I'm not a dinosaur.\n",

Last time it was all kinds of half-dragon, half-demon, half-elves trying to feel special.

I honestly thought the stuff we make fun of on here was confined to the late teens/early 20s sjw type and that it was blown out of proportion most of the time. Didn't think this stuff is now common place in highschools.  The difference is that when a kid decided they were goth 15 years ago, everyone knew it was just a dumb phase except for the goth kid. This gender identity crap is a fad disguised as progress, and the kids are getting outside feedback reinforcing that behavior and putting that idea into their heads that they're woke and discovering who they really are... nobody did that for punk/goth kids, because everyone knew it was retarded. And I mean... I'm sure it's helping some kids who are real-deal queer, but overall this shit seems like it has a potential to cause a ton of damage, unlike the fads previous generations had going for them.\n",

You could see a far greater disparity between urban and rural crime rates than in crime rates between races, does that somehow imply that the police are discriminating against city dwellers? Or does it just mean that people in cities are committing more crimes per capita than people in rural areas?  This idea that a disparity in outcomes implies prejudice is childish and stupid. Crime is complicated. A lot of things affect crime rates, and incarceration rates once arrested have a lot to do with what kind of lawyer you can or can't afford. Black people are more likely to get public defenders, and public defenders are shitty.

Well, they are not obliged to make a story about slavery. It is not a valuable nowadays because it is too trivial. It's basically a token plot right now. The peak of art was always about surpricing and shocking(withing the limits of course) people. You could invent something new or just show something familiar in a new unusual manner. Eh, i got a little bit off track here - it's just a game afterall, but anyway. I liked Jango because it was cool as fuck and it was a time where everyone didn't constantly try to shove a portions of wokeness into my face. I myself would like some anti-wokeness in a game - it would make furor and tickle the nerves of people really badly. For example, they could show how people take a pride and come to harmony by fulfilling their respective gender roles in the best possible and selfless way, and how it was important for society at that time, and how everything would fall without this. It's sensitive topics of course. I mean no one, including me, wants to provoke people to hatred and discrimination.  > social/historical immersion  That's not immersion. Having woke storyline in a game about 1899 year is a counter-immersion. That kills immersion. Usually, it wouldn't, but today it would. It's just my personal opinion btw. I pesonally didn't even like the look of main character in last god of war game because he suspiciously reminded me something i see too often nowadays, but lots of non-left people didn't mind it at all. I mean, they could choose the different form of beard, for fuck's sake...  Well, to summ up - they could have a story about slavery if they genueinly WANTED to. Irrelevant game journalist don't have a right to DEMAND this kind of a story from developers. Moreover, the attitude that developers are obliged to make a story about slavery kills the whole point of having it in the game.  > My point was about the accuracy of what this writer was saying  Tbh i didn't even read the article.

Fewer characters, fewer (and across the board shitty) stages, fewer costumes than SCII and barely half the customization parts of SCV… no improvements to Training mode, tutorials etc. either, still no Team Battle back. All they did is offer a CAS story component.  All they did is port old SCIV and V assets into UE4 and then charging full price for it. The models look abysmal… the weapon models are straight out of the PS2 era for instance.   I honestly hope that fails so Namco either takes some money and makes an acceptable game, or at least stops shitting on that franchise… SCIV, Legends, SCV, and Lost Swords were bad enough already.\n",

            "> You do realise that the last SC game was years ago and flopped right? At this point I'm surprised they managed to pull off this much with clear lack of budget.  The game sold 1.5 million copies in its first year. This might not even be below expectations since SCV was also labeled as a low budget game by most… and they sold CEs, a DLC char and 100s of CAS parts for further revenue.  Even if it didn't make Namco any money… I fail to see why I should care? Just because SCV was shit, doesn't mean SCVI is lacking any less.  This is the 6th main game, yet it has fewer chars than SCII. It is marketed as a SCI+SCII reboot, yet it lacks several chars from those games. I'd give them a pass on Mimics like Edge Master and Charade, maybe even Rock… but Hwang, Lizardman, Cassandra and Yun not available day 1 for free is just not acceptable. Even with all these included they'd have more than enough cut chars for multiple DLC seasons… before they have to touch the dreaded SCV chars.  The games always had alt outfits… this one does not… fucking why?  The game has the fewest stages of ANY SC main game… and I personally think most of them are fairly bland floating platforms with a backdrop. I personally think it's even worse than 5 and 5 had at least mass… and it's just nowhere near SCII.  > Training mode? Fantastic. A ton of useful information and settings.  Fine… what did they improve from 5? Which features are new? From what I have seen it seems to be the same feature set as 5. It still doesn't show basic data like initial, impact and recovery frames, or other props like adv, guard dmg, and meter gain of moves. No Hit Box visualization either. The game also doesn't seem to have a proper command training mode, or Combo Challenges (SCV had something with “Main Moves” and 5 example Combos… ) The training mode is passable but inferior to something like VF5, or even DoA5(!!!)  > The mechanics are awesome as ever. Probably needs a nerf to RE tho.  Yeah… I've heard that for SCV as well \"The Combos do Dmg again”, “JG raises the skill ceiling”, \"no negative GBs\"… didn't save the game from being a broken mess in the end… with a balancing patch that made it even worse.  I didn't mention mechanics since I only played the game for like 10-12h during the Beta and watched streams for a couple of hours. I personally think all additions and changes are detrimental, but only time will tell.  RE is just terrible, the omni guard feature is obnoxious and the fucking QTE minigame is one of the worst ideas I've ever seen in a 3D Fighter.  The meter omni GI from SCV was dumb, the meterless version from VI isn't any better though. Advantage seems to depend on Dmg of the GIed attack (and not timing as suggested before release), which I also find stupid, but no one knew for sure… maybe if the game had a better training mode… PGI being gone and with it the ability to GI UBs is a bit of plus, that you can't GI GBs at all… is just lame…  TE changes are crap as well… if they switch to directional breaks, they should have gone all the way to VF5FS's system, but that would take effort.  Lethal Stuns are just another worthless addition… another slowdown as if there weren't enough already and some of the trigger conditions are just fucking retarded. It's obviously better now with a training mode, but during the beta it was just “why did that just happen?”  Overall another regression from the game it reboots…   > But ye, not enough fucking hats 0/10  I personally don't care about CAS and think it's a waste of budget and disk space… but if you just port the unaltered 6-10year old assets into your new game, there is just no fucking excuse to only port half of them. The only reason they are doing this is so they can resell old assets as DLC it already started and the armor packs will most likely be primarily old stuff.  As a SC game VI is either stagnation or regression for the series, as a fighting game it simply lacks features you'd expect from a 2018 release… that starts with current gen models and ends with in-game frame data.

The point of PDD isn't that people get beat to shit. It's about appreciating the rare circumstances where there is actual equality at play.

Kidnapping is a weird one though. I’d like to hear a lawyer’s take on it, but I don’t believe this would count, since he gave them every opportunity to vacate his vehicle. However, if they demanded to be let out once he started driving and he refused, that again would be kidnapping.  BUT... That’s where part of my schtick comes into play; if he isn’t in a position to safely let them out—on the freeway, heavy traffic, etc—he could drive for a while (to the next exit for example) and be within the law, for “the sake of safety”.  She could be charged with trespassing in this case, I believe. Your personal vehicle is considered to have much the same consideration as your home in some states. It’s not likely anyone would prosecute for this type of nonsense though.  Source for my halfwitted/uncertain legal info: I’m a paramedic, and occasionally deal with “kidnapping” issues in the ambulance.

Tell a woman that and they will go insane, but it's a simple truth. The same applies to woman as well. I have know girls who cheated on their boyfriends because they would not put out for them. But in these situations, the girls wanted to get pregnant. In any case, I would guess she was bitter before the affair. It is a part of 'empty nest syndrome'.

Pressed my brother-in-law (super liberal/couple master's degrees) on this and he got to this exact point then seemingly aware of his inability to make his case changed the subject to 'white supremacy'.

            "In the state of California an engagement ring is a promise! Not an unconditional gift. By law it has to be given back unless its after marriage. What a fucking entitled slut cunt!  \"In California we turn to a law dating back to 1939 which specifically addresses engagement rings and other gifts in contemplation of marriage--Civil Code section 1590; it states: Where either party to a contemplated marriage in this State makes a gift of money or property to the other on the basis or assumption that the marriage will take place, in the event that the donee refuses to enter into the marriage as contemplated or that it is given up by mutual consent, the donor may recover such gift or such part of its value as may, under all of the circumstances of the case, be found by a court or jury to be just. In this case the \"donor\" is the person (i.e., the man) giving the engagement ring, and the \"donee\" is the person (i.e., the woman) receiving it. A gift in contemplation of marriage can be revoked, unlike other gifts. Thus, California law is very clear on what happens to the ring - if the woman calls off the wedding, it goes back to the man. Also, if both parties agree that the wedding is off then the man gets the ring back. This California law has wide ranging impact for property given in contemplation of marriage. In an important case on the subject - Shaw v. Shaw (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 159, a man and woman lived together for four years. He placed her name on real property because he relied on her promise that she would marry him when her divorce was final. The couple separated before marrying and the woman eventually married another. The court awarded all property back to the man because she failed to marry him. This has an impact on our society today because of the number of couples living together before marriage.\"\n",

            "Summary: Rekieta Law goes through Lawyer Mark Zaid's extremely long motion to dismiss Richard Meyer's lawsuit against Mark Waid for tortious interference and defamation. Zaid claims Waid is not subject to Texas jurisdiction and does some extreme twisting of logic and words to reach that conclusion.  The major hilarious points are  1. Waid/Zaid claiming he has no business in Texas but he regularly attends conventions there and even offered to do business with the owner of Antarctic Press in exchange for them not publishing Meyer's comic book. 2. Waid/Zaid claim that defamation was never done in Texas yet there is video/articles of Waid repeating his defaming points against Meyer at a convention in Texas. 3. Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not initiate contact with Antractic Press. Waid's own Tweets and previous statement contradict this. 4. Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not know Antarctic Press was located in Texas. Waid stated he knew the owners when he Tweeted he was calling them and called a Texas phone number.  The lengthy livestream where Rekieta Law tears apart the motion and is in full rant mode can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnTLB\\_xU9N4&index=12&list=PLJdwBXWZFqz5\\_7BI6iAA9HHjbc-LuY83D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnTLB_xU9N4&index=12&list=PLJdwBXWZFqz5_7BI6iAA9HHjbc-LuY83D)\n",

            "I chose the gender option on my PGCE course as I'm a computer science teacher it seemed like an important topic with all that goes on in computing industry and there is a significant gender difference at the GCSE level (girls make up around 20% of the cohort). One of the things i found hardest about this topic was finding any fucking evidence to support any of the claims that were being banded around. So many of the papers i read seemed to consist of them waffling on a lot, citing each other, and not actually producing any sort of data. Some of the data was blatently cherry picked, some didn't even support the claims that the paper was claiming they supported...I found the whole thing a complete waste of my life, i scraped a pass. The thing that pissed me off the most though was talking to one of the others on the course who bashed out his assignment over a weekend, found some vague sources which supported what he was saying for references and got just short of the top mark bracket for it. I'd spent the best part of 6 weeks of my life when i wasn't on placement, reading papers and writing my own. a lot of them are still on my kindle from where i sent copies to it to read on the commute.   In case anyone is curious, my conclusion is that the industry having a slightly higher ratio of females in tech jobs, than the ratio of university graduates, which in turn is slightly higher then the ratio of university applicants, which is compariable to girls taking the lower education levels indicates that there is no discrimination on the basis of gender, at least not at the industry level (individual companies may do, but its not a general trend) and if anything the numbers more indicate the industry making efforts to recruit and retain talented women where it could find them. This was supported by anecdotal evidence from recruitment companies who basically said skill women who could prove it could dictate their salaries and by the study which showed women have a 2 to 1 hiring advantage in stem subjects. I found a single study indicating that at the primary school level, girls and boys have a similar level of interest in technology (i think it was Finnish, which was apparent a mark against me, despite the fact i couldn't find any uk ones). Which by the time they are 14 has deminished to the point where they don't choose computing as an option. Despite the investment of huge amounts of resources, there has been no noticable change to girls taking up the subject. I was unable to find any data indicating at what point they lose it or why girls lose interest in technology, but felt that more research needs to be done on the 11 to 14 year old age bracket to investigate this trend.\n",

            "Some guy on youtube named Noncompete argues that all of video games failures are the result of Capitalism, that Capitalism itself only has two methods of increasing profits, that DLC, DRM, Microtransactions, Streaming, poor treatment of workers and anti piracy are all measures in one of those two ways, argues that marxism and unions are the only solution to making games and or gaming better and ends with a gamedrop.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  The video includes many many many many strawmen arguments  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Time to burn some strawpuppets  This will be faster if I just comment on the idiocy and ignore the constant strawmanning every two seconds  0:24 Bitcoin mining did not take up every card under the sun it was maybe 5 specific cards at most, no one was hoarding 750ti's in 2015 which you can still play gta V on  0:33 up until just before the bubble burst mining could easily offset the electricity costs  0:52 are you arguing that someone that openly pirates nintendo games wouldn't have cracked their copy of gta V?  1:33 there is more than one place to get roms  there is a lot of idiocy in this video, way to much to be normal, figured I would take this time while they rattle of strawman after strawman to write this part since there have been only 4 actual points in the 5 minutes of the video so far  4:59 Are they actually trying to argue piracy is a marxist issue?  5:40 \"there are only two ways to increase profits\" That is not true in the slightest, there are many many ways to increase profits that not include charging more or cutting costs, you act like consumers are a static non fluctuating number that you can only ever access a maximum sales number from. you argue as if there are only ever 100,000 gamers and that the only way to get more or less money is either cut your costs or rip off that 100 thousand its an amazingly limited viewpoint on how marketing works  6:53 The reason for telltale games failure was it failed to change, every game was identical because they were lazy not because capitalism forced them to do it, there are many franchises that barely change and profit year after year, telltales terrible writing, lack of gameplay are what caused to to go under  6:57 no videogames would do far worse if everyone owned their own labor and had workplace democracy because it ends up like trying to herd cats, everyone wants to do their own thing and push their own ideas leading to nothing ever getting done or worse feature creep, this is why there are team leads and company directors because when these people left a lone none of them could build a straight line without getting into an argument which direction it should face. (funnily enough you are literally arguing for a system like gamergate)  PS. horse you are a retard  7:20 You argue dead cells as if the company isn't founded on capitalism, the reason it can work as an \"idea sharing\" is because it has 11 people in it, telltale had 275 employees and you want them to all go their own direction? you also ignore companies like tale of tales that couldn't even function with 3 people, you disingenuously jump from comparing large scale productions to a team of 10, saying the failings are purely because those 300 people didn't have that same idea structure while ignoring the 100 or so other factors that lead to success or downfall  7:45 Steam =/= The companies on its platform, you instantly group everything on steam as capitalist when you don't know the composition of any of the studios on there, you cant sit there and argue Dead cells is a working example or Marxism but look at all this shit on steam its Capitalist scum conveniently ignoring Dead cells is on steam that is some amazing cognitive dissonance, since for all you know the Day Z guys could have been using the same team setup and Dead Cells  8:29 Gamergate wasn't about Anita, at least get one fact straight in the entire video  9:08 \"So one company made once concession\" This is literally the argument you are making to support marxism, that this one company succeeding using a system you like is what should tip the scales against all the other failures using that system  Now we end on more strawmen points\n",

No wars, no food shortage, plenty of entertainment, and this is the result—lack of respect, sense of entitlement, consumerism, excessive pride, false rape accusations because a ‘lady’ didn't get what she wanted, or crying about hurt emotions and Twitter ‘hate speech’, all instead of being happy to be alive and sheltered from real human hardship.\n",

First of all, the hard left -- who are essentially being led, knowingly or not, by a long-run communist insurgency -- only have command over *derive*.  The rest of us -- who are being branded as \"the right\" and all its variants (now even including Alan Dershowitz, for crying out loud), which includes the actual right -- have command over  *détournement*.  That has created an impasse.  It's not a stalemate, because active hostilities rage.  But neither side is really making progress.  *Détournement* allows all us anti-commies to hijack, derail and reroute ideas almost at will, while *derive* allows the commies to dominate any space they're able to gain entry into, be those real, virtual or corporate.    This is also different than historical radical movements, when the radicals commanded both strategies, but in a far weaker form due to much stronger institutions and cultural norms.  The online aspect changes the dynamics, but not as much as everyone claims.  For example, in the 2016 election, social media influence was ranked between 3rd and 7th in studies I've read in terms of significance in an individual's actual decision whether to vote and how to vote.  The stronger variables, by far, are still what they've always been:  family, community, peer-pressure (from flesh and blood people), faith beliefs, personal lived experiences, etc.  Fat feminist avatars shouting racist or cartoon frogs on twatter turn out to have virtually no measurable effect besides the latter enraging octogenarian boomer harpies who still can't grock that their Kween Killary hasn't been given her rightful Krown yet.\n",

Yes, protein and carbohydrates made us evolve but we can get it from other sources. Many more omnivores that go vegetarian/vegan see improvement in their health and mood. More vegetables = more minerals, vitamins, protein and fiber. Eating less meat = less fat, cholesterol and animal hormones. (+ less environmental damage and ethic related issues.)  You talk about our ancestors like they were eating so much meat. In reality, our ancestors’ diets consisted of only a very small amount of meat. You’re not really making anyone proud.\n",

            "In Italy, up until a few years ago, daytime television was heavily censored. For example, jokes that would put Christianity in a bad light used to be removed.   Since the early 90s we have something called \"the green zone\", a programming block suitable for all ages. That is: tits and asses are a-ok, as long as it's in soap opera or talk show form. But anything else is no-no-no.   An \"independent\" group called MOIGE (MOvimento Italiano GEnitori - Italian Parents Movement) used to dictate what was allowed on television, maybe they still do. Of course, this is Italy, everybody knew it was a front for the Catholic Church. The Simpsons episode \"Funeral For a Fiend\" (Season 19, Episode 8) was censored: when Kent Brockman lists a number of \"outlaws loved after their deaths\", Jesus is cut from the Mediaset broadcast. Sky broadcasts, however, are uncut.   They went as far as censoring the nipples and armpits of a male wrestler with an old TV set as his head because it promoted homosexuality, clearly. It appeared for less than 2 seconds... on a network ad promoting the green zone. That was in early 2000s on La7.  An insignificant change my ass.  That reminds me of late-blooming me staying up at 3am to watch \"Fouri Orario\" on Rai3, where they would, occasionally, show forbidden art films. Ah, those were the days!\n",
            "Yall still got porn on at 11pm or what?\n",
            "Nah, ahah! It's very clean, we don't have nightly talk shows so programming is mostly PG and TV-14 shows. Instead of airing at 10:30, like it's usually the case in the US, it's 11:00-30PM to 1AM. Some channels air R-rated movies exclusively after 11:00, but then again most are adapted for TV. Tinto Brass and such, if it ever airs nowadays, is after midnight.  That show at 3AM used to air very spicy stuff. I remember one with a scene where two adolescents (I think) have sex on a field, the camera is taken from the point of view of the girl and there's this silhouette of the other kid's tiny limp dick bumping on her body. 3 seconds, scared the shit out of 15-year-old me. Another movie I remember was a (gay?) drama where, in one scene, a man is giving a blowjob to some bearded guy behind a... mausoleum? And another scene in which one of those two men is impaled in the eye by a FUCKING REBAR! Still looking for the title. My guess it would be a precursor to New French Extreme, because it looked like it was shot in the late '70s, very early '80s, maybe not French, but unmistakably european.  Another two were most probably New French Extreme. One where a young man has his throat cut by some thugs in the middle of the street, and another one where a girl is raped. This last one I know is French, because in a scene she is standing next to an Intermarché.  I'm describing just these scenes because I was too much of a pussy to watch the whole thing, still am. But an enlightening experience nonetheless.\n",

These are probably the same people who think cross dressing is automatically transgender or that a little boy or girl who doesn't act \"100%\" male or female might be transgender.  Being transgender myself, I'll make my characters female if it has no major impact on gameplay, not this special in-between space. No doubt the non-SJW transgender people want to be seen as the sex they're transitioning too as well, not trying to pass off as someone intentionally trying to blur gender lines.  Nevermind history, even today the whole in-between thing doesn't work because out in public, people are going to address you as what they think you are, not what you claim to be.

Nobody gave a shit about this till sjws flooded in, I bought games that looked fun and didnt give a shit about male or female and only cared about whether or not they were well written, plot, gameplay etc. Such a non-issue that should be laughed at. Devs should make characters that are appealing to all because theyre likeable not to bigots who cant relate to someone unless they look, speak and act like them.    They pulled off a female character well in syndicate, I liked the twins and how they had their own playstyle. An assassins creed that has a female character that emphasizes more on skill and stealth would be cool, a feudal japanese era one with a kunoichi would be pretty awesome tbh.      I dont get the whole identify with the character you're playing thing honestly. You're playing a fictional fantasy game not rooted in reality, why do you need pixels to rep you and feel good about your gender its more important to relate to the characters as a person not a \"x or y\". you play games to pretend to be something you're not.       Personally in online games or customized character games I choose what looks more appealing or relevant and not based on my gender. Like a cute female sorcerer or a mountain of a man paladin.

            "You would have to be nuts to think that nonbinary isn't a thing  Saying there's no such thing as nonbinary is like saying \"there's no one who's ever worn a grey shirt. There are only black shirts and white shirts\"  or like saying  \"There are no ace people: everyone has sex.\"  or  \"There are no bisexuals: only gays and straights (if you even believe in gays)\"   There is an entire state of Russia that says \"There are no gays in Chechnya.\" *That* is what \"nuts\" looks like  No one used the term \"nonbinary\" 2000 years ago. But no one used the term \"bread\" or \"smartphone\" either. If you think there haven't been people in-between or outside of the M-F gender binary then you're actually too stupid to talk to so I'm wasting my time.  When you say \"I don't believe in nonbinary\" what you're really saying is \"I haven't met a nonbinary person and I feel secure that no one else has either.\"  And just to be clear: you understand that the premise of the game is that you sit in a machine that lets you re-live the memories of your ancestors... do you... do you think THAT is real? That would be truly \"nuts\"  My best advice: read a book. They have information in them that you don't currently posses and your ignorance is on display for the world   The post makes a good point though. SJW's are never satisfied. As far as I can tell they just want to spread around their own insecurities,. Maybe YOU should join up since that seems to be your goal\n",
            "Even as a transwoman, I don't know what the fuck non-binary is. The people who try to explain it do a piss poor job of it. It mostly boils down to \"you're a bigot for not understanding it\" which doesn't help explain things at all. It gets further confusing when I see people call themselves non-binary, but also a lesbian. Right now you're basically saying \"educate yourself\" without even bothering to point anyone in the right direction. \"Read a book\" doesn't count because there's a shit ton of books out there. Which are the \"right\" ones? Better yet if you're trying to convince us of your argument, how come we're the ones who have to do all the leg work?  Now I am aware of things like two spirited people, but that's mostly an ancient thing and not at all like how people say non-binary is nowadays.\n",
            "I can explain very simply: You know how you desire to be perceived a certain way? So do other people  By the same token that you wish to be perceived as female some people wish to be perceived as male. And by that exact same token some people wish to be perceived a way that is neither male nor female. It's not up to you or me to gatekeep which identities are legitimate.  Let me repeat that because it is the core of my \"argument\" (I'm not arguing with anyone. No one has made any point on the topic that could be considered logical or countered by logical argument. I am shedding light on ignorance)  >It's not up to you or me to gatekeep which identities are legitimate.  Do I understand what a \"non-binary lesbian is?\" No. I consider that label paradoxical. **But** that doesn't mean that it doesn't make sense to the people who use that label. I would have to talk to one of them to find out what it means to them  Using your ignorance as a stand-in for understanding is not the same as being informed; it is the opposite. People who do not understand an issue yet feel confident that they are correct are fools in the most classical sense of the word.   I was not attempting to educate. I was attempting to shed light on ignorance. It is too fucking easy to educate yourself for you to put the \"burden of proof\" on anyone but yourself unless you're in a debate setting. If you are ignorant in 2018 with a smartphone in your pocket it's because you CHOOSE to be that way. \"Read a book\" is a phrase I use to let people know that it's obvious that they do not take the time to consider the perspectives of others (and to belittle them because I value being informed and belittle those who are uninformed). Because once you've read a book by a person who believes things that you don't believe you immediately realize that your viewpoint isn't worth shit compared to the reality that we collectively experience.   I spent 2 sec to google [\"non-binary person interview\"](http://lifeoutsidethebinary.com/post/91182016548/interview-with-a-nonbinary-person-about-their) and here's just one of 10 million results. If you want to sit through a poorly-edited highly-slanted view of events I'm sure Buzzfeed has made a dozen youtube videos about nonbinary people. Just like all other perspectives you expose yourself to you will have to be a critical thinker (which I think we can all agree on considering this is the GamerGate subreddit). There are no \"right books;\" there are only books. There are no \"right perspectives;\" there are only perspectives. Some people's perspectives are informed and compassionate. Some people's perspectives are uninformed and uncaring. Who's viewpoints do you value?  Make choices. If you want respect then give it. If you want condemnation then spit it at others. If you want ignorance then spread it around. Everybody has choices. And we should all respect each others' personal choices because none of us are right about this world.  Hope that helps. And if it doesn't then I really couldn't care less, random-person-on-the-internet-who-chooses-to-talk-shit-instead-of-becoming-informed-about-an-issue-that-they-know-they-are-ignorant-about...\n",
            "This isn't about me gatekeeping identities. It's about how society at large will react. With transwomen, they are biologically male but they go through numerous processes to pass as female so that society will treat them as such. To try to pass as non-binary is going to get people to think you're either an effeminate guy or a tomboy. They're not going to see someone as being outside male or female. Do people make assumptions about gender? Sure, but they're right most of the time. You can't just go out in public, look like a man, then claim you're female and expect everyone around you to magically know you're supposed to be female. It may work among friends and in very specific spaces, but to the public at large, that doesn't work.  I'm well aware of dealing with people acting like experts on things they don't understand. I deal with this a lot on numerous subject matters like my autism. It's even worse over the Internet. I don't claim to be informed on non-binary. I freely admit my ignorance when it comes to that. However it doesn't mean I won't question it just like how I question everything else. Hell people question me a lot over me saying I'm a transwoman.  You're right. A lot of the stuff that can probably be found about non-binary are poorly done Buzzfeed study videos. Even if I did get informed, if I still choose to talk shit it doesn't mean I'm not informed. Perhaps if I heard what non-binary meant from a non-SJW viewpoint I would be a lot more understanding. I'm already in the same boat with being transgender and much of the transgender people mentioned in this sub are SJWs, making it look bad on us non-SJW transgenders. Blaire White is probably one of the only popular non-SJW transgender people and she gets a lot of shit from the far left because of that.\n",
            "I agree completely, especially about how hard it is to be a non-leftist transperson and how many people don't understand autism (30%+ amiright?).  But: you HAVE heard the definition of \"nonbinary\" from a non-SJW. It's just everything that isn't male or female (which means that it is INCREDIBLY broad. That's why it doesn't make sense to say there aren't nonbinary people).  You're right that society is totally geared to label people into M and F. But that's changing because people are changing.  Humans are naturally biased to reduce any topic down to a binary. But as we know that doesn't reflect reality; it is simply a shortcoming of the way we process information (and normally it isn't a shortcoming and it helps us solve a lot of our problems).  IMO 20 years ago a **huge** portion of society didn't *believe* in trans identities. They looked at a person and said: \"that's a dude in a dress\" or \"I bet that bulldyke is a carpet-muncher\" (or whatever they said. I wasn't old enough to notice so I'll just be as offensive and basic as I can imagine lol). But now trans identities are commonly recognized and generally understood (especially since the time when GG started). I foresee that a similar level of understanding will organically (aka slowly) spread over the next 20 years about people who don't feel comfortable identifying as male or female.  I might be completely off-base. Maybe society is only capable of being tolerant towards MtF and FtM and nothing else. But that isn't really the way societal movements move from my understanding of history.\n",

Plus it was so far over budget Chris had to sell his studio to Microsoft where it was stripped of IP and developer assets then shuttered.  This is Chris's MO. Wasteful directionless development that breaks its own successes so often that for every five steps forward it takes four steps back. Rather than creating a base mechanical system and then expanding on it, SC now has a hundred modular expansions but the core it in flux and every time it changes all of those modules need reworking. The dev itself is very good at keeping details from the public, but thanks to Star Marine being sent to a third party we know why it died. SIG provided what they claimed was a near final copy of the game engine, some years into development, and the module was built off that.... But of course the core was nowhere near competed so after doing a ton of work getting it sorted Foundry 42 handed back their version and found it was completely incompatible with the game engine SC had moved into by that time. Then, shortly after, SC moved to an entirely different game engine altogether. So the Star Marine module was entirely rebuilt. - for those of you keeping track at home, that means the module was scratch built three times before partial Alpha release, and needs constant work to keep it functional without adding new features or content even now.  Chris is currently on a yearly salary of over $900,000, more than even EA's CEO, he has multiple family members on the payroll for a total of over $3 million.... In perspective his families total salary earnings to date are over $20million according to their tax returns. You could develop a solid AAA-level game for that if you start with a functional engine. Is it any wonder people think there's a personal motivation to sell jpegs? That being said, I personally think it's worse than just a simple scam. I think Chris has started to believe his own bullshit, reinforced by the fan base, and doesn't realise he's a great visionary but a shit-tier manager.  Now come at me with all your best down votes you StarTards. I'm sure it feels weird to you, changing virtual numbers without needing a credit card.\n",
            "You do know that the fanbase calls him a god, holy, savior etc as a way to mock his shit tier management skills and the thing with Microsoft?\n",
            "Some of them do, but the fan base in general will still break into chants of \"Derek Smart\" to attack anyone who suggests time and money is being wasted. Any criticism of Chris is treated as heretical.  Edit: I've just checked the subreddit. In order to criticise the game without getting attacked you still need to kowtow and profess profusely \"I love the game, I love Chris, glory to SIG, Hail Star Citizen.... But just one small minor irrelevant thing\" its embarrassing. SC has the worst community of any online game at the moment, and it's not even a game yet.\n",

            "Sorry, I've been using Better Help for a few months now after hearing people like DeFranco talk about it. I haven't really been able to get much from regular therapy and it's hard to fit it into my schedule. Using Better Help hasn't done me wrong at any point. I don't see why everyone here seems to think the people aren't professionals when you can do a background check on anyone you're matched with to see the legitimacy of their credentials. Like, shit like this is why people don't get help for depression. There isn't a \"right\" way to do it.   The only shit I see people in here saying is that it's a trash app from people that don't use it. Every Better Help ad I've seen has been plainly listed and referred to as an ad. I'm genuinely curious how someone getting mental help or just having a therapist to talk to and suggesting it to someone else is \"shilling\". This just looks like such a hot take with no substantial evidence supporting it. Like, who is anyone here to determine who is or isn't legitimately depressed?\n",
            "> Like, who is anyone here to determine who is or isn't legitimately depressed?  I was going to leave a more detailed response until I got to this part. I think you're too close to this to view this from an unbiased point of view. I truly do hope you get the help that you need but please do understand that YouTubers (especially after the ad-pocalypse) would definitely take money from a company, pretend to be depressed, and manipulate their audience to try and get that sweet, sweet referral money.   Again, if it helps you than I am happy for you and I hope you get better but if you watched all three parts of these series and didn't at least get suspicious of some wrong-doing than I don't know what would move you.\n",
            "I'd rather you left your originally intended response and not assume things about me. I have no problems being corrected if wrong when presented with evidence to counter my claims. Dismissing me because of some perceived bias doesn't really do anything. I've used the service and it helps, how am I somehow less qualified to talk about it compared to the various people in here talking shit with 0 experience with it. If the problem is underhanded advertising, then fine, that's whatever. While I typically agree its fucked, the service seems genuinely helpful and the vast majority of complaints I see about it here have no factual basic. For what it's worth, while I did discover the service through Youtubers, I didn't use a sponsor link.   Also, even if someone isn't deeply depressed, having a therapist can be pretty helpful to just deal with different issues or provide some direction if it's needed. Obviously a person that doesn't need it if they don't feel a need for therapy or counseling. However, making it more available and advertising that service to people that aren't getting help but want it are fairly good things.\n",
            "> If the problem is underhanded advertising, then fine, that's whatever.  Dude, this is why I don't want to discuss it with you. You're way too close to this. It being manipulatively advertised **is a huge problem** that you can't just handwave away. In your whole post you just *briefly* touched on the topic of this being advertised in a malicious way. That's the whole issue at hand. If the product is great or not is not the problem.   A Lexus ES300 is a great car but if some salesmen walked around my parents retirement community and tried to dupe old people out of their money for a car they don't need than I would call that tactic a dirty underhanded ploy to fuck people over. Doesn't matter that the product is good or not.   Nobody is wanting you to be depressed or people not to reach out for help. People are just worried about manipulative advertising strategies used by Youtubers on their audience that trusts them.\n",
            "The first video posted doesn't even concretely prove anything. YouTubers experience burnout due to increasing lack of ad revenue, Better Help comes around, people start it and get sponsored by it. The closing statement in Memeology's video trys to say that based on the sole fact that different people use the service, it must be a shill. Hell, Boogie even said to not use his link if you didn't want to give him money.  Nobody is conning perfectly healthy people into signing up for online therapy, like your Lexus comparison would suggest. If that's happening, it's on the person doing it. The way info gets presented in the other vids, it suggests YouTube is forcing the sponsorship on creators, and that just doesn't make sense to me. Regardless of how a sponsor comes into play, if all relevant info being told about the service is true and the option to not participate in the sponsor link is there, how are people being manipulated? Also, not sure if I missed something or am just blanking, but I'm fairly confused why people are attacking the quality of the service. The 2nd video seems to joke about how the woman isn't a doctor, but I don't recall any claims of every professional being a literal doctor. That video also ends with by saying this projects depression onto viewers, and I simply don't get that. If you're that susceptible to other's words, you'd either have to be an actual child or you really do need therapy.  Without relying too much on speculation and by just looking at the info from the vids and my own experience, it seems that, at worst, BetterHelp and YouTube are partnered. YouTube identified relevant creators to be partnered with the service to advertise it. The information presented about the service and the service itself seem perfectly fine. I saw people having issues with being denied service and that they were suggested to see a physical therapist as opposed to online therapy. I get being upset at that, but how is that bad? Instead of not getting the help you need or giving bad help, they inform the person why the service wouldn't be beneficial to them. Like, I don't see what else could be done about that.\n",

It doesn't count women who have never led a country to war. It doesn't count numbers of wars lost; if one woman loses two wars, it only counts as one. It's possible that out of 100 female leaders, 30 went to war an average of 3 times each with no victories, for a 0-90 win/loss record (all against men, of course). It's also possible that of 900 male leaders in the same time period, all 900 went to war exactly once. 405 (or 45%) lost a war to another male leader. 405 beat another man in a war, and 90 beat a woman, totalling 495 (or 55%).

            "The only time they will talk about cameras in the back is to use it as a way to keep people in line. If they don’t say that some people will think it’s ok to do anything back there.   In some cases there are cameras but most likely there is not someone sitting there watching the feed. Those places are all about making money and they’re not gonna waste some on paying someone to watch all night  In regards to bringing this up with them keep in mind that where you live plays a roll. In some areas this may be less common but overall it’s important to know that strippers are whores who dance for money cause Whore houses are not legal   In just about every club you will see these options  1) table dance: here is where they will dance for you at your table or at the bar. Usually topless. Usually 10 bucks. This is where they will try to seduce you and upsell you on the other services, lap dance and champagne room   2) lap dance: average cost $25 per song. This is where things get a little more spicy and you can even fuck girls here. If you have a condom and she is ok with it you may be able to stick it in. Obviously you should know if she’s up for that sort of thing before you try. See if she lets you stick a finger in or if she touches your cock. Many of them while play with it here even out of your pants if they like you   3) this is the champagne room which is just for fucking no matter what you’ve been told. Some of these whores are master manipulators so if they can get you in there without having to fuck you they will. They’ll say they can blow you or that “you’ll have a good time” without being specific. You need to talk with them like they are merchants selling a good not like they are queens or princesses.   Most of these women have pimps no matter how normal they seem. They are not. These are not the girls who work at your local Starbucks or Whole Foods. These are dirty, filthy, criminal whores who are willing to do whatever they can for easy money.   If you seem like a pussy or a cop they will be skeptical. Be cool. Be confident.   There are different kinds of whores in strip clubs and some are more direct than others. Also there is a culture in these places. Two clubs on the same block may have different cultures. 1 club may be more open about what happens while the other acts is if nothing happens   Try to go to the one that is more open then try to find the girl who is the most straight forward.   Talk to her and ask if she does rooms. When she says yes ask her what she does back there. Most will tell you what they’re all about right there.   This is where you will want to negotiate   This is how it works   There will be 2 or 3 things you’ll need to account for   1) there will always be a cost for the room. This goes to the club and will provide you the room for your session. It is usually 15 minutes but can be 30   The cost will range between 50 and 100 bucks for the room and is usually non negotiable. The Whore doesn’t get any of this so she’ll want to cover that then add her cost   This is will vary based on the quality of the whore   The better looking the more they’ll ask for. Also depending on blow job or sex you’ll have a different price   If you want the get the nastiest whore in there expect the the room fee plus 50 to 100 for her  Better looking girls usually want at least 100 for themselves to fuck. Again this all varies and is negotiable.   My rule of thumb is never to go over 200 total but I’m usually drunk and go for the sluttiest over the hottest.   Make sure she tells you in plain English what you’re getting and you don’t just go off of “it will be good”  Have her agree to sex or head for the price you set and have fun.   I get the total cost from them and that’s it.   Thirdly sometimes there is like a bottle chick who brings you back there and sets up the room. They’ll try to sell you a bottle tell them no. Tip them if they are there and they’ll leave you alone while you fuck  Don’t tip them and they’ll be hollering through the curtain the second 15 minutes passes  Find a place where the whore has direct access to the room, talk about what she wants, negotiate your price. Again, sweet spot for me is 100 to 150 total.   I’ve had countless blowjobs and fuck sessions in clubs over the years and have loved every one of them.   I’ve even taken strippers home for free and fucked them but that’s another story and takes too much time sometimes   Anyway. Any other questions and I’ll do my best to answer   Edit: cameras will only be mentioned for lap dance area. Champagne room there is no issue with cameras as anything goes there.\n",

And now you're just ignoring the point. I don't care about diversity in overwatch. I'm stating what people on tumblr are complaining about. They're not complaining about trans inclusion that's for sure. Op is the one who brought that up. His one tame response might not even know what overwatch is, his moronic rant was crazier than most sjw shit.  I'm saying this whole thread is a joke for people to circlejerk over confirmation bias. All these posts nodding along like the op isn't completely retarded.  Meanwhile the actual complaints are not just tumblr and have been some very ongoing complaints in the overwatch community in general (outside of reddit).   Personally as an artist I do think \"sameface syndrome\" is a valid complaint. It's an understandable flaw for beginners or for a single artist who is self taught, but when a studio with dozens of artists on a single project make their female characters too similar looking (not identical) but have more extreme differences among all the male characters, then there's obviously some bullshit going on with the blizzard execs.\n",

            "Sure. So for years, games \"journalism\" was basically shit, and nothing but paid advertisement for the games they \"reviewed\". Everyone knew it.  Then one day, this girl who made a choose-your-own-adventure game started fucking games journalists for good reviews. Her boyfriend got pissed off and told the community at large about it, and this got gamers very angry with games \"journalists\". Gamers got upset at this new evidence of a long-standing problem, and it kind of became \"the straw that broke the camel's back\".  Rather than admit that it's wrong to take sex from game developers in exchange for good reviews, the games \"journalists\" decided to deflect from the issue by pretending that what the gamers were angry about was that a girl made a video game and that it got a good review. Games \"journalists\" all talked together privately and a couple of days later they all released articles that pretended that this whole debacle was about gamers hating women, and not about games \"journalists\" dicking female developers in exchange for good reviews.  No matter how the subject was brought up, they would plug their ears about the actual issues and try to shift the focus to \"gamers hate women\". Then the gamers started really going for the throat, doing things like reporting them for not disclosing sponsorships and affiliate links, doing all kinds of work to essentially expose all of their bullshit.  Meanwhile the games \"journalists\" kept doubling down, people started faking death threats to make this seem like a credible issue, and the opportunist women and \"journalists\" set up patreons and kickstarters to suck dry any chump who thought they were serious.  Nowadays, Trump is Making America Great Again, all of these games \"journalists\" and white knights are being found out to be accused (and thus by their own standards, guilty) of sexually assaulting women, everyone's well aware that games \"journalism\" is just paid advertisements and fake news, and we're over here laughing and having fun playing the same kinds of video games we used to, for the most part.\n",
            "So basically 5 guys are the reason trump is a president now\n",
            "Well it certainly didn't do any favors to the idea that journalists (generally speaking) are ethical, which is certainly a big part of what got Trump elected. Lots of people had known these journalists were just paid advertisements, and when they coordinated to fabricate a narrative in such a blatantly obvious way it left a sour taste in people's mouths. Then the mainstream media started trying to pull that same bullshit on Trump, and they got stomped.  On top of that, the social justice identity politics bullshit had been running wild in other media and hit a big brick wall when they got to video games. Nobody was having their bullshit, and they had no idea how to handle it except to cry and make shit up and fake death threats, so on the other side we just... let them. Because it was stupid, and it was clear to any reasonable person that it was stupid. And it worked. Gamergate found the cure to the social justice identity politics cancer.  So while I wouldn't say 5 guys is *the* reason Trump is President, I'd *definitely* say it contributed. Personally, another big factor is the fact that the social justice identity politics crowd is fucking insufferable and when they don't get their way their response is to get even *more* fucking insufferable and try to burn everything to the ground. Honestly, I think they're responsible for making more Trump supporters than any group of actual recruiters.  Thanks, retards!\n",

The coming election would have seen Johnson replaced,  that was already pretty much well known amongst the people in positions to know.

            "I'm sure you'll find at least one of these websites reliable.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses#Modern_developments):  >In the early 1920s, the use of sunglasses started to become more widespread, especially among movie stars. Inexpensive mass-produced sunglasses made from celluloid were first produced by Sam Foster in 1929. Foster found a ready market on the beaches of Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he began selling sunglasses under the name Foster Grant from a Woolworth on the Boardwalk. By 1938, *Life* magazine wrote of how sunglasses were a \"new fad for wear on city streets ... a favorite affectation of thousands of women all over the U.S.\" It stated that 20 million sunglasses were sold in the United States in 1937, but estimated that only about 25% of American wearers needed them to protect their eyes.  [Zenni Optical](https://www.zennioptical.com/blog/the-history-of-sunglasses-the-journey-from-function-to-fashion/):  >It wasn’t until the mid 20th century when sunnies really started to be used as we they are today. This is mainly thanks to Sam Foster, founder of Foster Grants, and Hollywood. In 1929, Foster sold inexpensive, mass-produced frames made specifically to protect people’s eyes from the sun on the beaches of the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Around this time, sunglasses were also beginning to be used widely among actresses, to hide from the paparazzi, and to cover their red eyes brought on from the powerful arc lamps needed for the low speed film stocks.  [StartUp FASHION](https://startupfashion.com/fashion-archives-a-look-at-the-history-of-sunglasses/):  >At the start of the century, they were a favorite accessory among movie stars. For actresses, they served two practical purposes. First, glasses helped celebrities disguise themselves from fans. Additionally, the lights used back then on film sets and in cameras were extremely powerful and harsh- flashbulbs even contained magnesium. Paparazzi flash was literally blinding, and often caused actresses to frequently suffer from red, watery eyes. To avoid being photographed or having to greet fans in this state, dark glasses were essential. Tinted lenses helped to alleviate and hide the symptoms.  >While these glasses were initially worn for practical purposes, the fact that they were worn by glamorous actresses gave them a celebrity appeal. At the end of the 1920’s, sunglasses became a full-blown fashion accessory.\n",
            "Great wiki link, you're describing the same shit that happened with Tom Cruise, except you're not including the fact that celebrities got paid to wear certain brands of sunglasses so they could be cheaply mass produced.\n",
            "Okay, you're just moving the goalposts now.

Mostly, you seem to be bizarrely indignant that I didn't happen to mention the existence of product placement in a throwaway Reddit comment. Do you think I'm somehow denying that product placement is a thing that exists?\n",
            "My point is that there are deals struck between celebrities and sunglass manufacturers to sell those cheap sunglasses, namely cheap wayfarers. If you wanna dig up who was doing it in the 20's you can go ahead.

            "Of course we do.  >In the early-to-mid 20th century, the phrase \"politically correct\" was used to describe strict adherence to a range of ideological orthodoxies. In 1934, The New York Times reported that Nazi Germany was granting reporting permits \"only to pure 'Aryans' whose opinions are politically correct.\"[2]  >As Marxist-Leninist movements gained political power, the phrase came to be associated with accusations of dogmatic application of doctrine, in debates between American Communists and American Socialists. This usage referred to the Communist party line which, in the eyes of the Socialists, provided \"correct\" positions on all political matters.   That is the history and that is how it is implemented today. Regardless of attempts to ~~redefine~~ mask the function, that is what it is at root.  Over-reaching collective orthodoxy is *always* a problem, always oppressive.  Doesn't really matter if the garnish is religious or \"secular\", it's still saturated in emotional beliefs rather than objective facts, and that's why it is described as pseudo-religion.  It follows the same social mechanics, the fervor, the ostracization of non-believers, the denial of objective facts for the purposes of The Party, the substitution of science with rationalizations, the same manipulations of brow beating or guilt-tripping or other forms of shaming.  This is one end of [PC culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUPsGDFZzVM) as an example of how bad it can get. *Abject* science denialism, rejecting dissent with manipulations according to PC \"rules\".  If science is \"oppressive\" then your views are not in line with reality whatsoever.  Admittedly, a lot of these people are marginalized.  It's just not for the reasons they claim(skin, genitals, etc).  It is because they are pants on head retarded.  It's that they think being \"politically correct\" has any basis in reality over being *factually correct.*  For this reason, there are some times when marginalization is called for.  Same reason we marginalize other stupid ideas or ideologies which have the end result of being objectively bad for society(the intent is irrelevant).  Why is intent irrelevant?  Because good intent often has ridiculously bad results.  Contrary to what these mental midgets learned in early life, it's not just \"the thought that counts\".  It's the *impact*.  There's nothing but good intent behind most anti-vaxxers.  They don't set out to breath new life into virtually extinct diseases, but it is a very real potential impact of their suggested plan.  Nobody really thinks they're the bad guy( barring socipaths/psychopahs and the like, as well as some epiphany about how they've made stupid decisions that got them into the situation they're in...Why?  these are statistical outliers).  \"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people that he didn't exist\" bears some merit in this case, and I say this even as an atheist.  People too unintelligent to know they're a danger to themselves and others, or those that know and successfully hide it behind platitudes and lip-service that sounds good to a casual observer...  \"Political correctness\" is one such term, as is \"Social Justice\" and a wide variety of language of leftist orthodoxy buzzwords.\n",

            "You know what annoys me about this. It's not the weird \"not oppressed enough\" vibe, it's that their argument doesn't actually make sense.  So they start with a number of LGBT individuals saying how they're \"just like you\". They also have a bunch of other unrelated traits that SJWs don't like, just to make sure that you know to hate them.  Then they present a bunch of supposed counter-examples to the idea that pushing \"we're just like you\" is bad, but their counter-examples are nonsensical.  1. A woman complaining that she accused of having kids for welfare. I assume because she's black. I was under the impression that the 'B' in LGBT stood for 'bisexual', not 'black', shows what I know! 2. A woman complaining about being harassed and arrested on the suspicion of being a sex worker. It's not clear why from the avatar though, but I'm guessing she's supposed to be South-East Asian? Either way, I'm not sure what the point is. Racism is bad, but what does that have to do with LGBT people? 3. Homeless woman(?) complains that their sexuality bars them from shelters. Giving them the benefit of the doubt that this is a real problem, it is actually relevant. What I'm failing to see is how that demonstrates a problem with \"just like you\" messaging. Surely if the people running these shelters understood that being gay wasn't really a big deal, they'd let this person in. Also this homeless woman has autism, that isn't actually relevant, but they pretend it is. 4. Immigrant from ???, at least that's what I assume. Ignoring the weird \"gender variant culture\" stuff, I'm not really sure what the issue is here, again. Colonialism was bad. Racism against immigrants is also bad. How is this an LGBT issue? 5. Victim of the War on Drugs. I'm guessing orphaned after the Houston Heroin Bombings of 2004. Seriously though, the war of drugs is bad and has had a lot of collateral damage. Again, how is this an LGBT issue? 6. Wheelchair user complaining about the world being inaccessible to them. Fair enough, I guess. I'm not physically disabled, so I don't know how bad it is for them, but it doesn't matter because it's *not an LGBT issue*.  So 6 examples and only one is clearly relevant (and even then includes some irrelevant stuff). None actually demonstrate the problem with \"we're just like you\" messaging though. Racism is bad, sexism is bad, ableism is bad, but none of those are problems that are relevant for the LGBT community.\n",

That'd explain their linking it to the sex industry, I think.  3, 4 and 5: What you said.  6: They say they don't want to be included in a society that \"makes it more difficult to live my life at every turn\" - I'm not really sure what they're talking about, since society has been making wheelchair accessibility more of a thing, hasn't it?

Only necessarily insofar as we support the idea behind freedom of expression, association, etc.  In other words, it's a matter of principle, not necessarily a preference for the individual involved.  I can understand people with no principles being confused by this, so I will explain:  The principle being, tech and media companies should not be playing gatekeepers of morality, thought police as it were.  The precedent being that not even the government is supposed to do this.  Just because it is currently legal(generally speaking) to do so does not mean that it is ethical, as in not oppressive, to do so.  Everything is legal until it isn't.  Slavery used to be legal, for example.  If Jones wins, it would be a legal precedent that can potentially protect everyone, *including you.*  See also: Businesses that are big enough or virtual monopolies of quasi-necessary nature can have a bit more obligation than your average Ma&Pa brick and mortar store.  This is where other anti-discrimination laws above and beyond the basic constitutional amendments have come into play as arguments were made and justified  to protect the life and liberty of people who were being oppressed.  As in non-governmental employers or housing being liable for discrimination.  See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law#United_States_of_America  It's not even necessarily legal.  Businesses that have a close relation to government can sometimes be liable for 1A breaches under \"state action\" or \"state actor\" connections. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_actor  There's also always civil law, where people can sue for damages.  TL;DR It's the principle of the thing, not necessarily loyalty to Jones. Also, there are myriad ways this could potentially be argued to be illegal(that is why courts exist, to make these determinations).  Legality is not limited to only the First Amendment.\n",

            "You can actually murder the cop if he is illegally arresting you. You'll need loads of proof that you were innocent of the crime that he was arresting you for, but yeah, unlawful arrest is hella illegal and there are a lot of legal precedents where people legally killed cops that were illegally arresting them.  A lot of people have a deep-seeded love affair with cops though, so they'll tell you that you *have to* comply with any order that a cop ever makes of you. Those people are wrong. You can not only fight off a cop that is illegally arresting you, you can murder a cop that is illegally arresting someone else too. That is what the US Supreme Court has ruled. http://www.constitution.org/uslaw/defunlaw.htm  In your specific example about being confused with a burglar, however, it would probably be ruled these days that the cops had \"reasonable suspicion\" to arrest you; which is basically a catch-all for any and all behavior that a cop wants to do. So the real question is: how much of the law will a cop/judge bend in order to protect themselves in the event of an unlawful arrest? The answer is: a lot. A lot of the law will be bent and even broken in order to protect a cop that commits an unlawful arrest, so you therefore would likely not be able to exercise your *right* to defend yourself from cops. Kinda scary.  There are a plenty of cases though, even recently, where people are found innocent of murdering an unlawful cop... but most of those people still spent time in jail, and were even badly beaten by other police (see the Ray Rosas case), so you'll probably still miss your flight... but there was a guy that killed a cop in self defense then evaded other cops for 6 days and was still found not guilty, so who knows, you might be able to catch that flight after all.  It's a very imperfect system, and anyone that you find defending it is usually incompetently ignorant of it and has a Just-World Fallacy and thinks that all cops are good guys and they only ever catch bad guys... or they are a cop themselves, and they benefit greatly from this fascist shit show.\n",

            "Is that an urban legend? I thought it was true.\n",
            "I can't find any sources that this \"urban legend\" is false, and it seems to be cited a lot in research papers -- and researchers even will outright assert that the difference is not caused by a failure of intent to die. So I think I'd trust the researchers slightly more than /u/Blutarg.  However, some of the [most cited](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-depressed-patient-and-suicidal-patient-in-the-Chang-Gitlin/25c937bfe845f9f133d794b5f2c917df114ecf67) stuff to this effect is very vulnerable to double and even quintuple counting. For this reason anywhere I read that says women are twice (or more) as likely to attempt I am skeptical of. For instance, [this website](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/), cites 1.2x based on the 2016 National Survey of Drug Use and Mental Health, so if there is a valid result that legitimately pegs it at over 2x, there is so much variance in our data that we have to question what we know. Moreover there at least some woozling going on at least in the non-acedemic sphere, since wikipedia links to [this](https://books.google.ca/books?id=db9OHpk-TksC&pg=PA191&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) as supposed evidence that women attempt suicide more than men, when the book references a survey of living people where women were more likely to have attempted suicide by an unstated amount.  On the whole, I don't have any data that suggests men attempt suicide more than women, and I do have data of varying quality that suggests that women attempt suicide more than men.\n",
            "Doesnt matter though. I would say the difference is almost certainly causes by a lack of intent and instead a cry for help. How could the researchers even possibly know that? Indeed the person themselves might not even realize they subconsciously took the less likely to kill you method  Its quite simple. Men kill themselves a lot more than women, so even if women Do attempt more, first the group that is actually dying should take preference, and second you have to ask if they do attempt more why are men dying at 4x the rate? The answer is because women take less certain suicide methods, but the only logical explanation for that is that it is a cry for help, even if subconsciously, because they know deep down people will help. Indeed there is no other logical explanation other than something as vain as \"women dont want to mess up their bodies\" which is much more ridiculous than suggesting its a cry for help.   There is only one logical explanation why women, if they do attempt more than men, only die at a quarter of the rate, and that is because they use it as a cry for help. If they actually had intent then they would choose a more certain methods. Indeed you say these researchers state it isnt due to lack of intent. First where is your evidence for this? Second, lets say that some researchers state that, what is the basis for it? Is it that they asked the woman and She said she intended to? If so thats bullshit, people will lie all the time to make themselves look less stupid, I certainly wouldnt want to be seen as looking for attention (not that that is what a cry for help is, but sadly some people see it that way) if asked so id probably lie too. Indeed even if we concede that they arent lying and believe they wanted to do it, the human psyche works on many levels and we do things we dont even think we in tend subconsciously a lot.  The reason that the while \"women attempt more\" claim is distracting bullshit can be split into the point below.   1. The evidence seems very shakey and is based on sources that vary wildly in their numbers. Furthermore it is ridiculous hard to define what counts as attempted suicide and what doesnt. Does someone slicing part of their forearm with a razor in a non lethal spot count? Someone taking a dose of paracetamol that is absolutely non lethal? Its so vague and undefined its practically useless. In contract someone actually killing themselves is a much more sturdy and verifiable figure  2. EVEN IF we are to assume that women attempt more, so what? Men are dying at 4x the rate, whether women attempt more is irrelevant we should absolutely prioritize the group actually fucking dying. Thats what I never got about the while \"women attempt more\" nonsense. Even if it is objectively true it doesnt matter as the group actually dying should be prioritize. Thats like saying \"4x more men died than women in said more\" and someone else saying \"yeah but more women got injured\". As related to above, not only is \"injured\" (just like \"attempted\") very vague, but its Also irrelevant, the group actually dying should be prioritized.  3. There is no other logical explanation that women apparently attempt at twice the rate but men die 4x more (I.e. For every 1 man who does 7 women attempt and only one dies) than woman arent using lethal methods on purpise as a cry for help. Indeed there arent any other logical conclusions, and there is far more sympathy and support for women than men regarding mental health issue, so that is the logical conclusion. Indeed you say that researchers assert that it is not due to a lack of intent to die. That poses a lot of questions. First why is this the one thing you havent provide sources for? Second what reasons do they give? Third, assuming the first and second question have a valid answer, how in the hell would they know, they arent the person themselves so it is impossible to tell what their actual intent is. Indeed people lie all the time when it comes to the intent of their actions. Not many suicide attempted who did do it as a cry for help are gna say \"yeah I never actually meant to kill myself I just wanted help\". Personally testimony is useless as people lie, especially in cases where it could seriously affect how people view them if they told the truth. Four, lets say that there is some evidence women dont have a less intent to die, and lets also assume none of them are lying if such evidence exists, its still useless because the person themselves mightnt know their intentions at the time. The human psycho works on many levels. Ever had a \"gut feeling\"? Thats often your body picling up on subtle hints that you dont consciously process. Sinilarly, even if a woman thought she wanted to die, her body might have picked up that crying for help would provide her the help she needs leading her to subconsciously picking a less lethal methods.   4. Lets say you somehow met the above 3 points. What is the reason then that it takes 8 women attempting to have the same number of deaths as 1 man attempting? No counter theory and its all use less, and even if you do have one, unless you can satisfy the above Four points, it wont be valid  That is the problem. If it takes 8x the woman attempting to have the same numbers of deaths as guys (assuming 2x higher attempt rate in women, and 4x higher actual suicide rate in men) then the only logical conclusion is theyre crying for help. If you want to provide another theory thats fine. But stating \"researchers state they intent to kill themselves\" with out evidence is useless, even if you have that evidence its Also useless as it is impossible for the researchers to actually understand the intent of another person, even if they do have some kind of evidence to understand their intent (E. G. Questionnaires) that is also not very helpful as it would require the replyees to not be free lying about a topic they would likely be lying about, and if we assume they arent lying then that doesnt a count for lack of intent as we cant know what subconsciously processes might have take place, as many times people do things they wouldnt consciously or didnt consciously understand because they were doing do subconsciously. Indeed I may think Im doing XX for someone to be helpful, when my subconsciously intent is something completely different based in a past experience.  And as I say, even if by some niracle we assume that this evidence you havent provide of researchers who, if it does exist, can apparently read minds, and if it is based on statistical data like questionnaires requires the woman not to be lying AND to not have any subconscious actions which make even her unsure of her own actions, even IF we assume you somehow have some magical evidence that fits all the above criteria,  AND on top of that, they have a differening theory which logically resolve the great disrepancy between actual suicide attempt to death rate, even IF you have all that (hint:you dont), it doesnt matter. Why? Men are dying at 4x the rate, thats what matters. Those are the figure that matter.  Indeed that is the most disgusting part about the \"women attempt more\" statistic that gets thrown around. Even IF we are to assume its true and women attempt more and have just as much intent as men, it doesnt change the fact that men are dying that 4x the rate. This is people fucking lives this is the largest killer of men under 35 in the UK and many other countries. Trying to deflect away from that and make it a womans issue by saying \"well women attempt more so women are actually more oppressed by this\" while men are out their dying in droves is the most sickening thing of all. Its not a competition, this is people dying. The way feminists try to use that to try and deflect and down play the fact that men are dying in the masses from suicide and instead try to make it a womans issue, ignoring the fact that in doing so theyll be driving resources away from men and leading to many more deaths, is the most horrific part of all. Even if the extremely suspicious \"fact\" of women attempting more AND having just as much intent is true, throwing that around to make your side seem more oppressed and doing so taking resources and attention away from men who are actually dying, is the most disgusting thing you can do, and purely evidenced why people say feminist is fuck all about equality.\n",
            "> That is the problem. If it takes 8x the woman attempting to have the same numbers of deaths as guys (assuming 2x higher attempt rate in women, and 4x higher actual suicide rate in men) then the only logical conclusion is theyre crying for help.  Are we absolutely sure that is the *only* logical conclusion? I think it is certainly the most obvious one, and one that should not be easily discounted, but *only*?  > it is impossible for the researchers to actually understand the intent of another person, even if they do have some kind of evidence to understand their intent (E. G. Questionnaires) that is also not very helpful as it would require the replyees to not be free lying about a topic they would likely be lying about  Correct, the researchers that have rejected the \"cry for help\" explanation likely do it based on simply believing the respondents. Furthermore you are right about the liklihood of lying.  >it doesnt matter. Why? Men are dying at 4x the rate, thats what matters. Those are the figure that matter  It does matter. Bluetarg said:  >>>that urban legend about women attempting suicide more often  When none of the responses have justified that as being false at all. If that was indeed false that would mean suicidal ideation is not something that has specifically female-gendered factors that may need addressing from a mental-health perspective. Just because it isn't an woman's issue from a mortality perspective doesn't mean it isn't an issue from a mental-health perspective.  And that matters because this goes both ways. Domestic violence is not a uniquely men's issue from a mortality perspective. It is however, a men's issue from a justice and social support perspective.\n",
            ">Are we absolutely sure that is the only logical conclusion? I think it is certainly the most obvious one, and one that should not be easily discounted, but only?  I see two:  1. Lack of suicidal intent, ie it's not actually a suicide attempt and therefore does not count. 2. Incompetence.  &#x200B;\n",

            "I don't share your positive outlook. However, I do think that the comparison to the evolution of art in the past two centuries is being mimicked by videogames.  Right now, we find ourselves in the post-modernist era of gaming, where some people are trying to figure out new ways to approach videogame development and playability, but generally speaking most participants are either cynical actors or snotty elitists that think their shit don't stink. And just like with post-modernist art, we are now seeing the kindling embers of the post post-modernism movement, with games such as Doom, BoTW, Mario Odyssey, RE7, SoulCalibur VI (and a few others), where the cynicism and corporate bullshit is worn-out, and the people involved just want to make games that core audiences have been begging for years, just updated to modern sensibilities and tech specs.  I'm sure you're now asking \"But isn't that good? We're getting rid of the trend-following ideologues, right?\", to which I say no, not really. See, post-modernism left a stain in the art world that will likely NEVER go away. Audiences, be them philistines or not, got it into their heads that being an artist means being a snooty cuntbag sniffing their own farts and making up excuses for pointless drivel. Critics, and the elitists in the art world, have also collectively agreed to circle-jerk that notion around. How's things going for post-post modernists? Not well, because even if their work is appreciated, even if it finds an audience, people just think of it as \"Oh right, classic-style art\", and don't give it any further thought, leaving new creators to either become another cog, or fall into obscurity.  Can this be solved? Well, the PPM in art is still going, under 30 years of existance, give or take, and only a FEW videogames fall into the equivalent state. But videogames are much more product-driven than Art, so the mediocrity of AAA shlock and the post-modernist douchecannoes flooding the market will still present a colossal challenge to anyone that doesn't have the backing of a major studio. I mean, Return of the Obra Dinn is kinda PPM, but it still doesn't much going for it, and doesn't seem to have much replay value.\n",

            "> I've read people insisting the Asians vs Harvard case isn't about Affirmative Action. Is that true?  Not directly. Indirectly, the reason Asians suffer is because of affirmative action. Theoretically, you could ensure that only white people would suffer from affirmative action, but that would lead to such a decrease in the number of white people that people's eyebrows might start to go up. You can rest assured that the SJWs don't want their own children to have a close to zero chance of getting into top schools.   So in practice, if Harvard loses, it's the end for affirmative action - at least in its current form. I am fairly optimistic now that King Kavanaugh is on the court.  > In any case, if Affirmative Action is upheld, what about reverse Affirmative Action? Could employers look negatively on applicants who might have benefited from AA?  Legally, no. In practice, they may try. This just ends up harming minorities who actually do have merit.

I've talked to my daughter about 2 of her friends before, and how their behavior was extremely negative to her and other people, and she deserves better than to be mistreated by her friends.  Both friends had parents that were uninvolved with teaching their children to think about other people, with the parents showing a lot of coldness to their own children.  Even in your original post, it all reads \"Do what I tell you\" and nothing about the importance of treating others well.  My wife has outright stated that women are the cruelest in their competition with one another.  Starting as a baby, girls are complemented heavily upon their looks, and this becomes the source of many girl's self-esteem rather than their achievements.  You can't change how you look, good or bad, but jealous girls can make others feel unpretty, ruin their confidence and destroy their clothes (or steal them, that's happened too).  This is where the \"Mean Girl\" personality begins to form that we're all familiar with, diminishing one another to put themselves in higher standing. All because the value of appearance is drilled into their head, rather than teaching them to be capable and independent.  I feel this is how female-superior feminists form, their tearing down of others has gone unchecked for so long it stays a valid tactic into adulthood.  Which is why MRA is even a thing.  Tear others down to get to the top.\n",

She was bragging about what she did, and most people where encouraging her and making an ass out of him (bouncer).  This wasn't right after it happened either, she showed absolutely no remorse, and was loving all the attention she was getting.  IMO she had to know what the rest of us knew regarding the video.

Her friend did tell her and she still decided to go all in because of the attention she was getting, and / or worrying about getting changed with something,  not realizing there was video of what actually happened.  Which would have made her a false accuser at this point.  Once the video hit the internet, her twitter feed got locked down, and I can understand why, it made her look really bad.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;\n",

You are new here and you don't understand the rules very well, much less the spirit that informs them - it is very very unwise to jump straight into a heated dispute as you are doing on the Michael Greger article.  Per the notice above you are edit warring, and if you continue doing that you are going to drive right over a cliff and get blocked.  So really  my advice to you is slow down and learn how we operate (and really learn!).  Ask questions about the relevant wikipedia policies and guidelines that govern our content.\n",
            "\n",
            "I am sorry about this, but if you really want to get involved, it turns out that Wikipedia is a pretty complex place.  Being an \"\"encyclopedia that anyone can edit\"\" means that over the years, Wikipedia has developed lots of policies and guidelines (PAG) to help provide a \"\"body of law\"\" as it were, that form a foundation for rational discussion.  Without that foundation, this place would be a wild west -  a truly ugly place, where people would just make shit up, about why some content should or should not be in an article, and it would devolve into a bar room brawl.   But with the foundation, there are ways to rationally work things out - if, and only if, all the parties involved accept that foundation and work within it.  One of the hardest things for new people, is to understand not only that this foundation exists, but what its letter and spirit is. (I keep emphasizing the spirit, because too often people fall prey to what we call \"\"wikilawyering\"\")   The more I have learned about how things are set up here - not just the letter of PAG and the various drama boards and administrative tools, but their spirit -  the more impressed I have become at how, well ... beautiful this place is.   It takes time to learn both the spirit and the letter of PAG, and to really get aligned with Wikipedia's mission to crowdsource a reliable, NPOV source of information for the public (as \"\"reliable\"\" and \"\"NPOV\"\" are defined in PAG!).   People come edit for many reasons, but one of the main ones is that they are passionate about something.  That passion is a double-edged sword.  It drives people to contribute which has the potential for productive construction, but it can also lead to WP:TENDENTIOUS editing, which is really destructive.  WP:ADVOCACY is one of our biggest bedevilments. \n",

They varied greatly from state to state as to their harshness and restrictiveness. Although the codes granted certain basic civil rights to blacks (the right to marry, to own personal property, and to sue in court), they also provided for the segregation of public facilities and placed severe restrictions on the freedman's status as a free laborer, his right to own real estate, and his right to testify in court. Although some Northern states had black codes before the Civil War, this did not prevent many northerners from interpreting the codes as an attempt by the South to reenslave blacks. The Freedmen's Bureau prevented enforcement of the codes, which were later repealed by the radical Republican state governments.\n",

However, since the Victorian era (with its rigid attitude towards the sexual), such relationships have declined, and there is a homophobic tendency to brand people who seek intimate (though non-sexual) relationships with people of the same gender as gay. This is something I regard as deeply unfortunate; it stems from our tendency to rigidly delineate what is \"\"gay\"\" and what is \"\"straight\"\".

            "Whilst I feel that this is probably diverting into a debate rather than discussing the article, I do think this reveals one of the fundamental flaws with this article.  It bases its observations, which IMHO verge at the very least on Original research, on how a particular country implements its digital TV system. For example, GeorgeFormby1 misses a great deal of context about the British situation which is relevant here, such as:\n",
            " Digital TV in the UK is strongly influenced by Freeview (and its soon to be launched sister Freesat), which are subscription free digital TV systems that the BBC (the UK's very dominant (compared to the US) public broadcaster is the key stakeholder in.  As pointed out by , Freeview boxes now retail at around £20 (actually around $40).  Although, it may seem a lot to pensioners in the US it is small compared to the annual, compulsory, Television licence fee of around £130per year ($260).\n",
            " Europe has traditionally had a much stronger regulatory framework with regards to broadcasting.  Where as, (if i understand correctly) in the US, cities are well served and rural areas often poorly served (in some cases having to pay to have affiliates and stations from other markets relayed to them so they can actually have a TV service at all), most of the traditional \"\"analogue\"\" channels in the UK and Europe(in the UK: BBC1, BBC2, ITV, C4 and to a slighlty lesser extent Five, whose availability is constrained by the amount of bandwidth that was left in Europe by the time it started in 1997)  are obliged as part of their licence to be available universally i.e. In the UK, >98% coverage of the UK landmass.  This means that European airwaves tend to be very crowded and together with the stronger licensing rules means that there are relatively few analogue channels (UK homes get 4 or 5 channels, and 6 in a *small* number of cities, where (usually) community groups are given a *low* power licence.)\n",
            " The above therefore identifies the reason why a lot of European countries had an appetite for more channels when digital TV came along.  The restricted space available, particularly terrestrially, has meant that channels tend to be crammed into the available space, and indeed some digital channels have a very poor picture quality compared to a good analogue signal.  But this only tells half the story, implementations vary even in one country, for example in the UK compare the bit-rates of BBC1 digital are at about ~6Mbps compared to those on Mux A which run at <2Mbps (e.g. Five Life et al).  Thus, the resultant picture quality is purely down to the implementation,  that various multiplex owners have chosen to take and is not indicative of digital TV in general.  Indeed, as I understand in the US, where homes generally have a much greater number of channels but are \"\"afflicted\"\" with the inferior NTSC system.  The application of digital TV has generally been to deliver HDTV as opposed to large quantities of new channels...\n",
            "... and indeed that brings the question of what it is all for! In the UK and Europe large swathes of digital space are reserved for the public broadcasters (without getting into a debate over whether all this space is used for programming that is truely public service), post digital switch-over this will allow every home in the UK to access free-to-air and  terrestrially (the way most people receive TV in the UK) channels such as BBC Parliament (coverage of parliament), BBC News 24 (likely to be the UK's only free-to-air rolling news channel before long), BBC Four (\"\"high brow\"\" arts and culture), Teachers TV (a channel for Teachers), etc, etc,.  \n",

The guy who's never fought, let alone beat a decent fighter besides Gonzales, who Jones totally shut out. That makes allot of sense. Regardless. Bernard Hopkins won a light heavyweight title and that's the bottom line. He was the first Middleweight in history to jump to the light heavyweight division and win A title in 1 fight. Something Ray Robinson failed to do. That's a fact and should be included in this biography. Erdei and the lineal title is a JOKE. What good is the stupid title if none of these guys have to defend it against decent competition? You can't hide behind a lame WBO title fighting nobodies and tomato cans and expect to be considered champion. Erdei is a disgrace and so was Michalczewski.

            "In 2001 Hurley was replaced as the face of Estee Lauder with Carolyn Murphy. However, Hurley stayed on with Estee Lauder and in doing so, ended the tradition of the company having a 'face'...after all, there were 2 faces. In the years following, Gwyneth Paltrow and Liya Kebede also joined the company as models, rounding out 4 faces. Currently, the company is fronted by Murphy, Hillary Rhoda, Paltrow and Hurley. The phrase 'lesser capacity' is misleading. Hurley models perfume, cosmetics and skincare for the company, something which Ms Murphy does not do (she does not model cosmetics), nor does Ms Paltrow (who does not model skincare). Only Ms Rhoda models all 3 as Ms Hurley does, but Ms Rhoda does not serve as the face of Estee Lauder's Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign.

            "I find the first sentences of this article very strange. I don't think vegetarians primarily eat plants or that it's synonymous with herbivore. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, honey, and yogurt, are not plants. Even plant parts is a bit of a stretch. Is flour a plant? My understanding is that vegetarians do not eat meat.   \n",
            "It looks like an accurate description to me. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, beans, and flour all come from plants - I don't think it's necessary to eat the whole plant to be considered to be eating plants. Plants aren't even mentioned in the first sentences of the article.  \n",
            "I see that mention of plants has recently been removed. The word vegetarian obviously indicates a plant-based diet.  \n",
            "A nut may come from a tree, but it is not a plant. See dictionary. Yogurt is not a plant. Honey is not a plant. Fruit is not a plant. You seem to be confusing the meaning of words, which is problematic for someone working on an encyclopedia.   \n",
            "I think you'll find that trees are plants. Foods that come from plants are plant-based foods. It isn't rocket science.  \n",
            "The article seems have been clarified which is helpful. Clearly there is a difference between a herbivore (a moose or cow for example) and a vegetarian that eats plant based foods like nuts, fruit and sometimes non-plant based foods dairy. Cheers.   \n",
            "I removed a newly-added sentence in the intro saying \"\"Some vegetarians eat eggs and fish\"\" because the very next sentence says exactly the same thing.   \n",
            "\n",
            "I removed \"\"focusing on plant-based foods\"\", since a diet of solely dairy products and eggs, while unhealthy, would technically be vegetarian. Simply put, not all vegetarian diets \"\"focus\"\" on plant-based foods. As per the citations, vegetarianism is really just defined by what it excludes, not what it includes. -  \n",

            "Correct, they are not plants. Just in case anyone is still confused: nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, and flour are all plant-based foods; they come from plants. Honey, yogurt, other dairy products, and eggs are animal-based foods; mushrooms and yeast are fungus-based foods; and algae (including edible seaweed like kelp) are none of the above. Also for the record, I'm vegetarian. -  \n",
            "(response to Michig) I don't understand your logic here. If some vegetarian diets do not focus on plant-based foods, then would it not be inaccurate to make the blanket statement \"\"vegetarian diets focus on plant-based foods\"\"? -  \n",
            "Can you seriously imagine a vegetarian diet without plant-based foods? The lede should summarize the article, and if you read the article it discusses plant-based foods all the way through it. The Vegetarian Society's definition: \"\"We define a vegetarian as someone living on a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruits, with or without the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or crustacea, or slaughter by-products.\"\" Doesn't that sound very plant-based to you? The plant-based foods are the fundamental part of the diet, with some'' types of vegetarians also adding dairy and eggs.   \n",

            "\n",
            "One of the main rights of humans, as well as countries is the right to freely choose its name.  One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one.  This time I will not respond to the insults posted by User:Makedonas, User:Nestore and User:Vergina because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia (Just to quote the last comment by User:Makedonas: This is a country which was a part of Jugoslavia,where a lot of people are Albanians,where they speak a bulgarian dialekt,and they want to have a greek name)!!!???. \n",
            "For me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country, so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this.\n",
            " History: Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians, even with the ancient Greeks!  Actually, all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks, ancient Macedonians, Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks, Slavic population etc.  For example, the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population.  Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians, but that doesn’t give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia.\n",
            " Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century.  Actually, the northern part of Greece was called “Northern Greece”. Meantime, Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia. Starting from that point, the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops, airports, streets etc got the Macedonian name.  So, Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years, but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 (that is 60 years)!\n",
            " One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority. It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity. Actually, during the Civil war in Greece from 1945-1949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there.  Many of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes.  Nowadays Greece doesn’t recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language, culture, education etc.\n",
            " Very interesting fact is the following: Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries. Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG! So far, Belgium never disputed that.  In our situation, Greece has a province called Macedonia, but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name.\n",
            " Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories. Even if that is true, Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically, politically, military etc, so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece, especially by using the name Macedonia.\n",

            "Serbia was a country during Selimović's life for 19 years before Yugoslavia was (1910-1918 Kingdom of Serbia, 1918-1929 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, 1929 SCS was renamed Yugoslavia)., And it was also one of the Federal Republics of Yugoslavia. This is why on the Yugoslav censuses, \"\"Serb ethnicity\"\" was an option, which Selimovic selected. \n",

            "Your implication that he changed nationalities from Bosnian to Serbian to spite Sarajevan \"\"harrasment\"\" is ridiculous because he was not addressing his nationality in the letter, but rather his ethnicity, which is an unchangeable characteristic.\n",
            "The Serbian language's standardization was devised by Karadzic in 1818, 17 years before the Croatian latin alphabet was standardized by Ljudevit Gaj, and 32 years before Serbo-Croatian was devised at the Vienna agreement. If you read Mesa Selimovic's books you would know that the modern standardized Serbian language is older than both modern standardized Croatian and Serbocroatian as he wrote a book discussing Karadzic's reforms. Also there are Croatian and Serbo-Croatian dialects that are not mutually understandable with the modern standardized Serbian that Selimovic wrote in, namely Cakavian and Kajkavian.\n",
            "You say Biographies are reliable sources. Then read this excerpt from Selimovic's own autobiography \"\"Sjecanja\"\" that he wrote himself and you will find the following quotation: \"\"Potičem iz muslimanske porodice iz Bosne, a po nacionalnoj pripadnosti sam Srbin. Pripadam srpskoj literaturi\"\" -> TRANSLATION: I COME FROM A MUSLIM FAMILY FROM BOSNIA, BUT BY ETHNICITY I AM A SERB. I BELONG TO SERBIAN LITERATURE\n",

Given this and Kuja's already substantial section on the list of FFIX's characters, as well as the fact that describing IX's story comprehensively will require a pretty thorough explanation of him anyway (sales figures aside, he is the central conflict of the game, really; the same can't really be said of Seifer with VIII or Seymour in X; in order for them to get proper coverage, they'd have to get their own articles), it seems to me like him having his own article's kind of unnecessary. Any discussion of him is really a discussion of the game's story, and any discussion of the game's story is going to largely be a discussion of him, so I just think it will probably make for some somewhat unnecessary reiteration across the three articles (Final Fantasy IX, List of Final Fantasy IX characters and Kuja).\n",

            " Answer from Falun Gong talk page \n",
            "\n",
            "Katsam, Im a Falun Gong practitioner, if youd like to listen to what i have to say, i can answer your questions briefly from our point of view. Many people see Falun Gong in different ways, some criticize it and some other people practice it, youll hear many things from many people but in the end its up to you to make up your mind about it. Falun Gong or Falun Dafa is a cultivation system of mind and body, there are the 5 sets of excercises to practice and there are the books for reading which contain the teachings of Mr. Li. \n",
            "The purpose of our practice is to assimilate to the principles of \"\"Truth Benevolence Forbearance\"\" and letting go of attatchments, all this is substantiated by the practice of the excercises which provides you with gong, gradually cleans your body and evolves many things for you. A religion can be a cultivation system but not necessarily a cultivation system has to be a religion, so Falun Gong is in no way a religion of some sort, we dont pray or worship any gods at all and there are no \"\"churches\"\" or enrollment sistems, people practice voluntarily and you can start or stop whenever you want. \n",
            "\n",
            "You can practice wherever and whenever you want and as long as you want, There are practice sites where you can go if youd like to share your practice and time with other practitioners too. There are no ranks in falun gong, there is an assistant who teaches the excercises to new people and coordinates the group practice. Mr. Li is often reffered to as the \"\"master\"\" by the students because of respect but he never asked to be called this way.\n",
            "\n",
            "According to our point of view, to be practitioner is to be a person who wants to be better everyday and who wants to improve himself in all the aspects of his life but as you may have noticed, not everyone is perfect and we can all make mistakes during the process of cultivation, everyone has their own attatchments and personal problems that they have to overcome but with patience i think anything can be achieved, so this is why some people feel compelled to practice it more than other types of Qigong.\n",
            "\n",
            "About the persecution, our point of view on the matter is that there came to be so many falun gong practitioners in China that the government decided to \"\"supress\"\" them in order to prevent that the Chinese people would start following principles different from the Chinese Comunist ideology. Supression or persecution, however its called, something is happening. Some other people may deny it, the government might say there is nothing going on but we believe its very clear that there is something going on. You can identify the practitioners at the practice sites while they do the excercises or you can just ask, true FG practitioners dont lie, if they dont want to say something, perhaps they wont say it, but whatever they say must be true, thats the way it should be. But i wonder now, how can you supress this practice by just telling people not to do it? we think there is something beyond that, which is torture. If you want to legally forbid something, you have to have a reason for it, so if you dont have it, you come up with it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Everything i just said is the FG practitioners point of view on the matter and in no way it represents the opinion of everyone present on this talk page, perhaps later on you might listen to the critics point of view, again all i can say is that its up to you to make up your mind about it. If youd like to see some pictures or know more about the practice from the practitioners point of view, you can go to this webpage www.falundafa.com  \"\n",
